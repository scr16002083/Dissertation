There have been a few programs in this subreddit which offer a similar functionality but mute spotify, and play another locally-stored song. I preferred not using that method and hence did this.

The code is present below, and is also present in my github repo [here](https://github.com/SakDev/SpotiByeBye).

Once again, I truly would appreciate any constructive feedback!

**Edit**: Thank you so much for your positive response!!!! I've added a readme file to help anyone understand the gist of setting up the Spotify API to get your Client ID and secret.

~~And to all the people who claim this is stealing, I just wanted to say that while it does test ethical bounds, this program merely restarts Spotify using legally-obtained data from Spotify.~~

My [course on Pandas](https://www.gormanalysis.com/blog/python-pandas-for-your-grandpa/) has been released!  ([View on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9oKUrtC4VP7ry0um1QOUUfJBXKnkf-dA))",l1jdcj,Reddit - r/Python
90,"Howdy, y'all. I'm Al Sweigart (rhymes with ""why dirt""), author of ""Automate the Boring Stuff with Python"" and several other programming books. I release all of my books under a Creative Commons license, so you can read them for free on my website at https://inventwithpython.com

My latest books are [The Big Book of Small Python Projects](https://inventwithpython.com/bigbookpython/) and [Beyond the Basic Stuff with Python](https://inventwithpython.com/beyond/). I'm currently working on a book about recursion (the recursion jokes get funnier every time I hear them) which should be available in 2022. The ideas for this book grew into [a 2018 North Bay Python talk I gave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfBqVVKg4GE).

""Big Book"" contains the source code for 81 games, puzzles, simulations, and animations that were designed to be short and simple to understand. Folks tend to get caught up in repeating yet another ""hello world"" tutorial, but don't quite know how to apply the programming concepts they learned into actual programs. This book is full of source code that they can study to see how real-world programs work. They aren't just code snippets but actual, runnable programs. If you've been told you should ""work on your projects"" but don't know where to start, or if you've been told ""look at the source code of open source projects"" but found them undocumented and inscrutable, check out these programs.

""Beyond the Basic Stuff"" is a sort of follow up to ""Automate the Boring Stuff"" (or any other beginner Python resource). It goes into how professionals write code and best practices they follow. There's information on how to find help on your own, how to format your code and name your variables, an explanation of common programming jargon, the basics of Git, three chapters on object-oriented programming (and more importantly, when and why to use OOP), and more.

You've probably seen [my posts at the start of the month](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/obq0cg/automate_the_boring_stuff_with_python_online/) when I make my online Python course free. About 15,000 to 30,000 people sign up each month, though according to my stats only about 5% of people actually complete the course (which is typical for online courses, free or paid).

I got started writing programming books in 2009 when my then-girlfriend was a nanny for kid who wanted to learn to program. I started writing a book (which would become Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python) and self-published. People liked it, so I kept writing, and Automate was my first book through a traditional publisher, No Starch Press.

For the last 1 yr, we had made our contributors team meetings public(everyone could listen and participate during the meeting). And this is what happened in our last meeting - **While we were sharing news about upcoming Jina 2.0 release in the zoom meeting, some loud racist music starts playing automatically and someone starts drawing a d\*ck on the screen.**

[Video clip from the meeting - someone zoombombed at 00:25](https://reddit.com/link/npkm6o/video/8a16kolvlk271/player)

It was demotivating to say the least.

Building open-source project is challenging at multiple fronts other than the core technical challenges

* Understand what needs to be built
* Improve that continuously
* Help people understand the project
* Educate people about the domain
* Reach out people who might benefit from your project
* Collaborate with other contributors
* Deal with issues/PRs
* Deal with outdated versions/docs
* **Deal with different opinions**
* Sometimes deal with jerks like the ones who zoombombed us

The list is long! Open-source is hard!

Open-source exists because of some good people out there like you/me who care about the open-source so deeply to invest their time and energy for a little good for everyone else. It exists because of communities like r/python where we can find the support and the motivation. e.g. via this community, I came to know of many use cases of my project, problems and solutions in my project, and even people who supported me build it.

I wanted to vent out my negative experiences and wanted to say a big \*\*Thank you\*\* to you all open-source people, thanks to many(1.6k) contributors who made it possible for us to release \[Jina 2.0\]([https://github.com/jina-ai/jina/](https://github.com/jina-ai/jina/)) 🤗.

117,"In my spare time I like to go through financial data to understand what kind of companies exist, how sectors and industries evolve and to test theoretical frameworks. However, I found that it required a lot of effort to figure out which companies belong to which industry and I often ran into paywalls that blocked me from accessing the exact data I was looking for. Platforms like Bloomberg offer such services but at ridiculous prices (up to $24.000 a year). This can make investment decisions for the retail investor rather difficult especially if you don't want to follow 'the herd'. **I wanted to change that.**

**Insert the** [**FinanceDatabase**](https://github.com/JerBouma/FinanceDatabase)**.** A database of over 180.000 symbols (80k+ companies, 15k+ ETFs, 30k+ Funds, 3k+ Cryptocurrencies and more) that is fully categorised per country, industry, sector, category and more. It features a 'Searcher' package (***pip install FinanceDatabase***) that has a user-friendly way of collecting the exact data you want (downloaded straight from the repository). For example, the following code returns all (listed) airlines in the United States (check [Examples](https://github.com/JerBouma/FinanceDatabase#Examples) for more info) :

    import FinanceDatabase as fd
    
    airlines_us = fd.select_equities(country='United States', industry='Airlines')

And the following gives insights in ETFs that have anything to do with 'semiconductor':

    import FinanceDatabase as fd
    
    all_etfs = fd.select_etfs()
    semiconductor_etfs = fd.search_products(all_etfs, 'semiconductor')

What I explicitly am *not* trying to do is re-invent the wheel (again) of Fundamental Data gathering as there are tons of packages out there that do that already (i.e. [FundamentalAnalysis](https://github.com/JerBouma/FundamentalAnalysis), [yfinance](https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance), [sec-edgar](https://github.com/sec-edgar/sec-edgar)) but instead allow you to capture sector, industries, specific types of ETFs or cryptocurrencies that would have otherwise resulted in a lot of manual work. Then, when you have this sub-selection you can make use of the earlier mentioned packages.

**If you want to know what is available inside the Database, please have a look** [here](https://github.com/JerBouma/FinanceDatabase/tree/master/Database)**.** Alternatively, you can do the following (an example):

    import FinanceDatabase as fd
    
    equities_countries = fd.show_options('equities','countries') # or sector/industry
    etfs_categories = fd.show_options('etfs')
    cryptocurrencies = fd.show_options('cryptocurrencies')

I hope this can help some of you out making (better) investment decisions and all feedback (positive and negative) and contribution is much appreciated.

I am new to reddit, and after reading some posts of people expressing their frustration learning Python, I thought I would write about my own story on how learning Python helped save my life, and perhaps more importantly, gave my life meaning. I will try to be as brief as I can in my back story to keep this as relevant to Python as possible, but I feel it would be a disservice to leave it out completely, as my issues with mental health were a primary driver of the motivation I took advantage of to learn Python. I will post a more detailed description of my backstory later in r/addiciton or r/depression_help or something similar. Feel free to skip to the second \*\*\* to go straight to when I started learning python, however I suggest you read the whole post because honestly my whole story is relevant. If I hadn't gone through what I went through, I doubt I would have had the motivation to self-teach myself Python.

I grew up in a wealthy, extremely homogenous town within an hour of New York City. I went to a public school, but if you saw the way people dressed, it looked more like a private prep school. The vast majority of the kids in my school had parents who were millionaires. My parents were not. I was an only child, and I grew up in a small apartment on the ""poor"" side of town (""poor"" meaning houses/ apartments went for &lt; 750k). As you can imagine, the social structure of the school was entirely based off the wealth of your parents. So the game was rigged against me from the beginning. I had very few friends at a young age, and most people in my middle school probably would have described me as a ""loser"" or another synonymous term. I was very unhappy and became addicted to video games as a mean to escape my life. During high school, I finally started branching out to meet people from the surrounding towns, who were not nearly as pretentious as the people I grew up with. I made a lot of friends and started to have a legitimate social life. However, with this new social life came a lot of superficiality and drinking/drug using. 

Until my senior year of high school, my grades were mediocre at best. Because I hated my social life at school, I hated school in general. But in my senior year, something changed. I won't detail it in this post, but will certainly get into it more in my next post in r/addiction or r/depression_help . I improved my grades and went to community college for my first year. I ended that year with a 3.9 GPA and an acceptance to one of the best colleges in my state. I transferred to that college and thought my life from there on out would be perfect. I was wrong.

I hated the social scene of my college. I found it to be very superficial and revolved almost entirely around drinking. Later I realized that while this was true for the people I was surrounding myself with, nobody forced me to surround myself with those people. I did it because I thought that this was the only way to enjoy college, and if I didn't, I would be missing out on the experience of my life. Man, what a load of BS I let myself believe. This expectation set me up for failure, and I blamed myself entirely. I thought I was worthless, a loser, and that all the mean things people said about me in my hometown back in middle school were true. I fell into a deep depression and eventually dropped out. 

Towards the end of my time away at this state school, I saw a psychiatrist who prescribed me Adderall and Xanax to treat my depression and learning disabilities. In the beginning, they worked wonders, but they certainly didn't solve the underlying issues, they actually made them worse. After I dropped out, I began to rely on them completely. Before long, I was blacking out all the time as a result of the Xanax, and up for days at a time as a result of the Adderall. It was always one or the other, and I had to use the other to counter the negative effects of one. 

For the next few years, I battled with addiction and depression to the point where I felt hopeless. I would get a week or two or three sober, then relapse. Somehow I managed to go back to a local college during this time, but my grades were mediocre, because I would miss a week of school every time I would relapse. Eventually I went away to rehab for four months. This is where I started to learn Python. I was very fortunate to have parents who loved me enough to spend the money to send me to a place for four months. I know not everyone has this privilege, and it is my goal to pay my parents back the money they spent on me.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The rehab I went to was basically in the middle of nowhere, and while I was inpatient the first month, the last three months I was in what was essentially a nicer version of a sober house. I worked part- time at a restaurant (\~20 hours a week). I had computer access, and I found myself very bored during the first week or two, so I decided to learn something I had always wanted to learn: Programming. I bought a few courses off [udemy.com](https://udemy.com) for \~$12/each (NEVER pay full price of a Udemy course. You can always get them discounted), and started learning. Pretty much anytime I wasn't working or going to AA meetings, I was programming. I essentially replaced my addiction to drugs with an addiction to learning. I really enjoyed it, but in hindsight, I overdid it, as any addict does. I came home after four months, and I fell back into old patterns, and relapsed just before I would have been 6 months sober. I will go into more detail about this in my posts in r/addiction / r/depression_help .

During my time in rehab, I completed 3 Udemy courses on Python, but honestly I only really learned the fundamentals. I've never been a very quick learner, as I have a processing disorder (I was always the last one to finish tests in school and it always took me longer to do assignments etc). I frequently got frustrated, and rarely took breaks. I would spend 4-8 hours a day practicing coding, but much of that time was obsessing over one thing that I couldn't figure out. This was a big part of why I burnt myself out. Later, I found that if I ran into a problem I couldn't figure out, and forced myself to take a break, 95% of the time I would figure it out within 10 minutes of coming back from a 15-20 minute break. The mind is funny like that. 

Fast forward about 6 months and I was back in rehab, this time for only 30 days. I came home and luckily got an internship at a very small investment firm, where they used python to trade stocks algorithmically. There, I had a boss who was a very good programmer, and he gave me real projects to do that required me to think critically. He rarely gave me any help. Most of the time when I asked a question he would say ""I know the answer, but you have to figure it out. It's the only way you'll learn"". This frustrated me at the time, but looking back it was probably one of the best things anyone ever did for me. I developed resourcefulness and patience, two incredibly imperative skills for any programmer who wants to be worth his/her salt. During this time, I was taking a few classes at a local college to finally finish my degree, and I was working anywhere from 15-40 hours a week at this investment firm, unpaid. I honestly worked a bit too hard, I almost burnt myself out again, but I managed to get through it. I was very lucky in that my parents helped me financially during this time, which allowed me to focus more on school and work. I had a few relapses during this period, but they were short and mild, so it didn't throw me off track too badly. 

Over this past summer I finished up my degree (I majored in Business) and started looking for jobs. I was sure to put as much of my accomplishments at the small investment firm that involved python on my resume as I could. Covid was (and is) still wreaking havoc on the economy, so I worked extra hard applying to jobs, making connections, and keeping my skills sharp. I honestly probably applied to over 2500 jobs. I only got maybe 3-4 interviews. I had one during the end of the summer that went to the final round, and I was sure I was going to get the job. I didn't. Instead, the company (according to a connection I had made within the company cold-emailing people) decided to hire people from India to save money. I definitely felt pretty hopeless at that point. But I didn't give up. Maybe a month later, I got an interview for a job at a major company as a Data Analyst. I had three rounds of interviews plus I had to send them examples of some of my Python projects. I didn't get my hopes up like I did last time, out of fear of being disappointed. To my surprise, I got the job. I had asked for a 50k salary. They gave me 60k base plus a 5k bonus contingent on my performance, plus great benefits. 

I've been at this job for a little over a month, and I honestly love it. I find myself excited to go to work every day, and the people really like me because I am able to provide real value to the company. In my first month, I worked a lot on automation of otherwise very manual tasks (usually involving excel or emails). I would ask people how many hours per week they would generally spend on such a task and wrote it down. I recently did the math and realized that I have so far saved the company over 750 hours of work per year, and that’s a conservative estimate using a 48 week year (to account for holidays, vacation etc.) and the low end of their estimated range of hours per week. This frees the employees up to work on more value added (and frankly much more interesting) projects. My work there is just beginning, and there are a ton of projects I am really excited about.

\### (Please go to the next ### if you have no interest in hearing anything non-Python related)

I can honestly say I am happy now. I have over 4 months sober, and I rarely have any cravings to use drugs anymore. I really think this is largely because I found purpose in my life. That said, I still attend AA meetings often because I know I have to keep my sobriety my first priority. Without it, I have nothing. I also know that life isn't going to be perfect every day. While I do consider myself happy today, I still have bad days. Such is life. I stopped expecting to feel good all the time. Life is not designed that way. Before, I was only ""happy"" if I had a substance in my system. Also, ""happy"" to me was a euphoric rush which felt good, but was never fulfilling. Now I define happiness differently. It doesn't mean I feel good all the time. It means that despite sometimes not feeling good, I can appreciate how lucky I am to be alive and how blessed I am to have been given a second chance. Getting out of the rut that I found myself in a few years ago was the hardest thing I have ever done, but it was 100% worth it. At the risk of sounding corny, I really do believe sometimes you have to fall down hard and struggle getting back up to appreciate your life.

Learning Python was part of my journey, and it wasn't easy at all. When I started, I had a lot of doubts that I could do it. I didn't think ""people like me"" would be successful at something like this. Again, I was wrong. While I am certainly not even close to an expert at Programming/Python, I am good enough to be hired at a large company and good enough to make a difference. I'm sure there are people on Reddit and elsewhere that could make me look like I started programming last week. But I try not to compare myself to others. I instead try to compare myself to who I was before, and who I want to be in the future. As I’ve said several times before, I will make another post with more details about my experience with addiction/depression and give my general tips for life there, but for now here are my general tips for learning Python:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

1. I suggest starting with the fundamentals. I used Jose Portilla's Udemy course for this and it was great. I will link it at the bottom along with some other resources.

2. If you struggle motivating yourself to follow online courses, try figuring out a real project to do that can actually help you in everyday life. This could be automating something you do in your job, for school, or just something you think will be fun. 

3. Work Hard. Don't give up. But don't burn yourself out. Take frequent breaks, especially when you get frustrated. 

4. Ask for help. If you’re struggling with a specific problem, r/learnpython is great, along with [Stackoverflow.com](https://Stackoverflow.com) . People have helped me with many problems there.

5. Trust the Process. Programming is a lot like learning an instrument in my opinion. At first it can be grueling and you won’t be able to do much for a while, but after you learn the fundamentals, it becomes incredibly enjoyable. 

6. Be consistent. This is extremely important. Try to set aside a time every day to practice. Even if it’s only 20-30 minutes. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

There are many more tips that I have but those are the most important ones I can think of. Please feel free to follow me as I hope to be quite active on reddit in the future. If you have any questions, please message me. Whether it's about Python, Addiction, Depression, or whatever else. I'll do my best to answer everyone I can.

What to learn next is an often asked question. [Searching for `what next` on /r/learnpython](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/search?q=what+next&amp;restrict_sr=on) gives you too many results. Here's some more Q&amp;A and articles on this topic:

* [I know how to program, but I don't know what to program](https://www.devdungeon.com/content/i-know-how-program-i-dont-know-what-program)
* [Learning by converting code from one language to another](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/5503pa/code_conversion_probably_the_best_tool_any_level/)

* [If you want to learn you'll need to be willing to look stupid](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/5jm97p/if_you_want_to_learn_youll_need_to_be_willing_to/)

* [Things you might encounter in your programming journey](https://www.techinasia.com/talk/27-things-started-programming)

## Exercises and Projects

I do not have a simple answer to this question either. If you feel comfortable with programming basics and Python syntax, then exercises are a good way to test your knowledge. The resource you used to learn Python will typically have some sort of exercises, so those would be ideal as a first choice. I'd also suggest using the below resources to improve your skills. If you get stuck, reread the material related to those topics, search online, ask for clarifications, etc  — in short, make an effort to solve it. It is okay to skip some troublesome problems (and come back to it later if you have the time), but you should be able to solve most of the beginner problems. Maintaining notes will help too, especially for common mistakes.

* [Exercism](https://exercism.io/tracks/python/exercises), [Practicepython](https://www.practicepython.org/), [Edabit](https://edabit.com/challenges/python3) — these are all beginner friendly and difficulty levels are marked
* [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/), [Adventofcode](https://adventofcode.com/), [Projecteuler](https://projecteuler.net/) — more challenging
* [Checkio](https://py.checkio.org/), [Codingame](https://www.codingame.com/start), [Codecombat](https://codecombat.com/play/level/dungeons-of-kithgard) — gaming based challenges
* [/r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer) — not active currently, but there's plenty of past challenges with discussions

Once you are comfortable with basics and syntax, the next step is projects. I use a 10-line program that solves a common problem for me — adding `body { text-align: justify }` to `epub` files that are not justify aligned. I didn't know that this line would help beforehand, I searched online for a solution and then automated the process of unzipping `epub`, adding the line and then packing it again. That will likely need you to lookup documentation and go through some stackoverflow Q&amp;A as well. And once you have written the solution and use it regularly, you'll likely encounter corner cases and features to be added. I feel this is a great way to learn and understand programming.

## Debugging

Knowing how to debug your programs is crucial and should be ideally taught right from the beginning instead of a chapter at the end of the book. [Think Python](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/) is an awesome example for such a resource material.

Sites like [Pythontutor](http://www.pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit) allow you to visually debug a program — you can execute a program step by step and see the current value of variables. Similar feature is typically provided by IDEs like [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) and [Thonny](https://thonny.org/). Under the hood, these visualizations are using the [pdb module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html). See also [Python debugging with pdb](https://realpython.com/python-debugging-pdb/).

Debugging is often a frustrating experience. Taking a break helps (and sometimes I have found the problem in my dreams). Try to reduce the code as much as possible so that you are left with minimal code necessary to reproduce the issue. Talking about the problem to a friend/colleague/inanimate-objects/etc can help too — known as [Rubber duck debugging](https://rubberduckdebugging.com/). I have often found the issue while formulating a question to be asked on forums like stackoverflow/reddit because writing down your problem is another way to bring clarity than just having a vague idea in your mind. Here's some more articles on this challenging topic:

* [What does debugging a program look like?](https://jvns.ca/blog/2019/06/23/a-few-debugging-resources/)
* [How to debug small programs](https://ericlippert.com/2014/03/05/how-to-debug-small-programs/)
* [Debugging guide](https://uchicago-cs.github.io/debugging-guide/)
* [Problem solving skills](https://ryanstutorials.net/problem-solving-skills/)

Here's an interesting snippet (modified to keep it small) from a collection of [interesting bug stories](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/169713/whats-the-toughest-bug-you-ever-found-and-fixed).

&gt;A jpeg parser choked whenever the CEO came into the room, because he always had a shirt with a square pattern on it, which triggered some special case of contrast and block boundary algorithms.

See also [curated list of absurd software bug stories](https://500mile.email/).

## Testing

Another crucial aspect in the programming journey is knowing how to write tests. In bigger projects, usually there are separate engineers (often in much larger number than code developers) to test the code. Even in those cases, writing a few sanity test cases yourself can help you develop faster knowing that the changes aren't breaking basic functionality.

There's no single consensus on test methodologies. There is [Unit testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing), [Integration testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_testing), [Test-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) and so on. Often, a combination of these is used. These days, machine learning is also being considered to reduce the testing time, see [Testing Firefox more efficiently with machine learning](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2020/07/testing-firefox-more-efficiently-with-machine-learning/) for example.

When I start a project, I usually try to write the programs incrementally. Say I need to iterate over files from a directory. I will make sure that portion is working (usually with `print` statements), then add another feature — say file reading and test that and so on. This reduces the burden of testing a large program at once at the end. And depending upon the nature of the program, I'll add a few sanity tests at the end. For example, for my [command_help](https://github.com/learnbyexample/command_help) project, I copy pasted a few test runs of the program with different options and arguments into a separate file and wrote a program to perform these tests programmatically whenever the source code is modified.

For non-trivial projects, you'll usually end up needing frameworks like built-in module `unittest` or third-party modules like `pytest`. See [Getting started with testing in Python](https://realpython.com/python-testing/) and [calmcode: pytest](https://calmcode.io/pytest/introduction.html) for discussion on these topics.

I was inspired to make this after finding that applications like Excel, Tableau and JMP were often quicker than Python for ad hoc viewing, plotting and reshaping. This project aims to make basic EDA easy but also allows you to easily move DataFrames in memory between the GUI and IPython so you still have the full power of Pandas. It's made with PyQt5 and renders in a standalone window compatible with any IDE.

190,"Spent 5 hours coding for what could have been hundreds of hours of work. I can't believe I actually did it. Lol

Of course I did it with the help of my google-fu but the fact that I was able to do it is such a great feeling of accomplishment. Received a ""Great Work!"" message from my boss too.


EDIT: HERE'S WHAT I DID. I kinda messed up not including this in the main post.

Basically I needed to make comparison of a new cloned server vs our old one.

It has hundreds if not thousand of tables that I'll need to do binary check sums of to ensure that the newly created servers and dbs are completely identical and that the etl procedures are loading the data correctly with the correct data types and values etc.

So without automation I'll have to do this hundreds if not thousands of times manually:

Run checksum code on old server then run on old server, save the checksum results on an excel worksheet as documentation if they or did not match.

What I did is I created a python automation program that gets a list of all tables in a db within a server, then iterates over all those tables and executes the binary check sum query again and again using the tables on a list then saves all the query result on a csv file. 

I appended the csv output names with the server name to make them distinct after every run. Then I load that csv to an excel file and then do the final IF comparisons there. 

So instead of doing that manual comparison for hundreds of hours, I was able to do it in 5 hours of coding and now runs for 30 second per database then voila, instant results.

## What is PyBoy

In short, it’s a Game Boy emulator written from scratch in pure Python, with additional support for scripting through an API. We’ve added type definitions, which allows us to compile the software using Cython to get performance comparable to emulators written in C and C++.

## Installation

The installation instructions are simple: Install SDL2 on your system, and install PyBoy through `pip install pyboy`. If you need to compile from source, we also have detailed instructions on the GitHub Wiki for Mac, Linux and Windows.

[https://github.com/Baekalfen/PyBoy/wiki/Installation](https://github.com/Baekalfen/PyBoy/wiki/Installation)

## Features

PyBoy is designed to be accessible from Python, so we support and encourage people who want to make experiments, bots or AI’s to try it out. We are building game-specific wrappers, which at the moment allows programmers to interface with Tetris and Super Mario Land, without any intricate knowledge of the Game Boy. Documentation can be found at: [https://docs.pyboy.dk](https://docs.pyboy.dk/) .

We also want to learn and experiment with more exotic features. Based on work from a university project, we’ve added rewinding to the emulator. Which means, you’ll be able to turn back time in any game.

Recently I had to integrate Python as a scripting language into a large c++ project and though I should get to know the language first. And let me tell you, it's simply magical.

""I can add properties to classes dynamically? And delete them?"" ""Functions don't even care about the number of arguments?"" ""Need to do something? There's a library for that.""

It's absolutely crazy. And I love it. I have to be honest, the most amazing about this is how easy it is to embed.

I could give Python the project's memory allocator and the interpreter immediately uses the main memory pool of the project. I could redirect the interpreter's stdout / stderr channels to the project as well. Extending the language and exposing c++ functions are a breeze.

Python essentially supercharges c++.

While I was explaining my logic, I made sure I was emphasizing the letter 't' whenever I pronounced myDict (so that it doesn't sound like my\_dick). Anyway, while I was typing the solution and explaining, obviously, my brain started concentrating on the code and I wasn't paying much attention to what I was saying. Apparently, my pronunciation started sounding like 'my dick'. On top of that, I was using that dick so much to the point that interviewer started laughing.

**Frequently Asked Questions:** (*read this before posting questions*)

* This course is for beginners and assumes no previous programming experience, but the second half is useful for experienced programmers who want to learn about various third-party Python modules.
* If you don't have time to take the course now, that's fine. Signing up gives you lifetime access so you can work on it at your own pace.
* This Udemy course covers roughly the same content as the 1st edition book (the book has a little bit more, but all the basics are covered in the online course), which you can read for free online at https://inventwithpython.com
* The 2nd edition of Automate the Boring Stuff with Python is free online: https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/
* I do plan on updating the Udemy course for the second edition, but it'll take a while because I have other book projects I'm working on. Expect that update to happen in mid-2021. If you sign up for this Udemy course, you'll get the updated content automatically once I finish it. It won't be a separate course.
* It's totally fine to start on the first edition and then read the second edition later. I'll be writing a blog post to guide first edition readers to the parts of the second edition they should read.
* I wrote a blog post to cover [what's new in the second edition](https://inventwithpython.com/blog/2019/10/07/whats-new-in-the-2nd-edition-of-automate-the-boring-stuff-with-python/)

249,"I do freelance python development in mainly web scraping, automation, building very simple Flask APIs, simple Vue frontend and more or less doing what I like to call ""general-purpose programming"".

Now, I am reasonably skilled in python, I believe. Don't write OOP and class-based python unless I am doing more than 100 lines of code. Most often write pretty simple stuff but most of the time goes into problem-solving.

But I despise freelancing. 1 out of every 3 comments/posts I make on Reddit is how much I hate doing freelancing. I come to Reddit to vent so I am sorry to the fellas who is reading this because they are more or less my punching bag :( I am sorry sir/madam. I am just having a bad life, it will end soon.

So, today I am going to rant about one of the more """"fun"""" things of freelancing, client telling me they know python.

Whenever a client tells me that they know python, I try to ignore them but often times I have to entertain the idea anyway because jobs are scarce. I keep telling myself ""maybe this will work out great"" but it doesn't.

It never goes right. Here is the thing. If you do what I do you will realize the code is often quite simple. Most of the effort goes into problem-solving. So when the client sees the code and me getting paid by the hour, ""They are like I thought you are *best darn python developer* I could have written that myself!""

My immediate impulse is to go on a rant and call that person something rotten. But I have to maintain ""professionalism"".

Then there is the issue of budgeting. I do fixed payment contracts for smaller engagements. But oftentimes these python experts will quote me something that is at least one-fourth of a reasonable budget. And by reasonable I mean non-US reasonable budget which is already one-fifth of a reasonable US programming project budget. But anyway they quote that because they know how is easy it is to do my job.

There is more because this is rant by the way. So, clients with python knowledge will say to me ""I have this python file..."" which is the worst thing to say at this point. They think they have done the ""majority"" of the work. But here is the way I see it-

a. Either they have just barely scratched the surface
b. They have a jumbled up mess
c. They had another dev look into the project who already failed
d. They had to do a ""code review"" of their previous freelancer and they ended up stealing the code

There is no positive way to imagine this problem. I have seen too much crappy code and too much of arguments like ""they had done the work for me, so I should charge near to nothing"".

People don't know exactly why senior devs get paid so much money. Junior devs write code, senior devs review code. That is why they get paid more. Making sense of other people's code is a risky and frustrating thing and it could be incredibly time-consuming. And moreover in most cases building upon a codebase is more difficult than writing it from the scratch.

Doctors rant about ""expert"" patients earning their MDs from WebMD and I am seeing the exact same thing happen to me with clients knowing how to write loops in python.

Python is easy to learn, programming these days is easy to learn. But people are not paying programmers for writing loops and if statements. They are paying them to solve problems. Knowing the alphabet doesn't make you a poet. And yes in my eyes programming is poetry.",jm9dnh,Reddit - r/Python

254,"Hey folks! My friend and I are building [Devbook](https://usedevbook.com). It’s a desktop app that allows you to search in Stack Overflow, search and read documentation, and search public code on GitHub from a single place. The whole app can be controlled just using a keyboard. No need to use your mouse. This way, it’s easier to stay in the flow.

The app works similarly to Spotlight on macOS. You hit a global shortcut and Devbook appears as an overlay over the currently active app. This way you minimalize the needed context switching when looking up information. You almost don't leave your coding editor.

You can think about Devbook as a search engine made just for developers. But no ads, content marketing, SEO, etc.

I thought the community here might find it useful. Currently, we support Python, Flask, Django docs, and adding more with time.

Give it a try and let me know what you think!

**EDIT**

Some folks have been asking us for the pricing. Devbook is free. The plan is to build team features later on and have subscriptions for teams and organizations. If it will be possible, we want to always have a free plan for solo developers.

However, if you really want to support us, I just set up the [Buy Me A Coffee page](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/P8dyVmoAF) for Devbook. You can donate a small amount if you feel comfortable. It will probably make us jump around from the excitement since it would be our first revenue:)

**EDIT 2**

Oh, boy did this blow-up! Every week, we just share Devbook in various subreddits we think might enjoy it. We didn't expect to blow it up that much at all. Thank you all folks for trying Devbook out. It means a lot.

**Frequently Asked Questions:** (*read this before posting questions*)

* This course is for beginners and assumes no previous programming experience, but the second half is useful for experienced programmers who want to learn about various third-party Python modules.
* If you don't have time to take the course now, that's fine. Signing up gives you lifetime access so you can work on it at your own pace.
* This Udemy course covers roughly the same content as the 1st edition book (the book has a little bit more, but all the basics are covered in the online course), which you can read for free online at https://inventwithpython.com
* The 2nd edition of Automate the Boring Stuff with Python is now available online: https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/
* I do plan on updating the Udemy course for the second edition, but it'll take a while because I have other book projects I'm working on. Expect that update to happen in mid- or late-2020. If you sign up for this Udemy course, you'll get the updated content automatically once I finish it. It won't be a separate course.
* It's totally fine to start on the first edition and then read the second edition later. I'll be writing a blog post to guide first edition readers to the parts of the second edition they should read.
* I wrote a blog post to cover [what's new in the second edition](https://inventwithpython.com/blog/2019/10/07/whats-new-in-the-2nd-edition-of-automate-the-boring-stuff-with-python/)
* **You're not too old to learn to code. You don't need to be ""good at math"" to be good at coding.**
* Signing up is the first step. Actually finishing the course is the next. :) [There are several ways to get/stay motivated.](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/wiki/faq#wiki_how_can_i_get.2Fstay_motivated_to_learn_programming.3F) I suggest getting a ""gym buddy"" to learn with.",i1w03b,Reddit - r/Python

There's a great package called ConfigParser which you can use which simplifies creating config files (like the windows .ini files) so that it takes as much effort as hardcoding!  You can get into the hang of using that instead and it should both help your code more scalable, AND help with making your code a bit more maintainble as well (it'll force you to have better config paramters names)

[https://lazyweb.ai](https://lazyweb.ai)

We're a little two-person team (Angie and Jem). We're bootstrapping and self-funded. I'm the programmer.

I wanted to share it because it was a fun and interesting project to build, and Python made it possible for us to get a long way as a small team. It uses serverless on the backend (AWS). We're using Spacy and GPT-2, and some PyTorch models. It uses BeautifulSoup for spidering/crawling/content retrieval. The front-end is React.

It has a different type of user interface to any other search engine, as it is chat based. And it lets you choose how you view results, either visually like an Instagram feed or cards, or minimal like Hacker News or the old Google. It tries to fight SEO spam and strips out ads and ad-tech from search results.

We have a project on GitHub with Jupyter notebooks and sample data with experiments and scripts, including examples of querying other search APIs, and to generate example utterances programatically to use for NLP models with sources like Wikipedia, StackOverflow and Wolfram|Alpha:

295,"TLDR: 60 sec video here:[https://streamable.com/1y17lt](https://streamable.com/1y17lt)

TLDW: When I want to **automate actions on a site**, such as logins or forms, or scraping pages with JavaScript, **I manually** inspect each web element I need and begin writing a script.

***I'm lazy though*** and had the idea to automate the creation of these automation/testing scripts. And thus ""Sillynium"" was born.

Sillynium allows you to **draw boxes around the elements you require** on a page and automatically gets the element and its properties for you. Different coloured rectangles tell the program you want to do different things. Eg: Red means ""Input text"", Green means ""Click button"".

**When you've finished drawing boxes, a working python selenium script is generated**. If you run that script, it does exactly what you told it to do! All this without you writing any code, and losing time.

**Working 60 second video link of program in action**: [https://streamable.com/1y17lt](https://streamable.com/1y17lt)

I made this project over the course of a day as a quick and dirty proof of concept. Its very flawed in its current iteration (taking a screenshot of webpage), so V2 I'm trying to figure out how to draw directly to the browser. Critique it and rip it to shreds. I'm aware of browser recorders btw so I know those exist, this is my twist on automation

**Edit**: I was not prepared for the amount of interest in this little proof of concept! So thank you all very much for your time you’ve made my day :)

In the interest of transparency and to answer your questions about the code and my plans:

I originally thought about monetisation (web extension etc) after finishing this POC (\*\*sigh i know I’m a greedy bastard) but now I’m in 2 minds about it!

On the one hand I want to make it free for personal use, on the other hand I’d like to potentially charge for commercial use (once its finished).

*Final edit 2* The community has spoken, I WILL BE RELEASING THIS VERSION AS OPEN SOURCE! I did some light refactoring, and have added it to a repo which will be shared in a follow up. It shows the POC and the community is welcome to build on the original idea :) 

I will create a follow up post with links to repo once I’ve created it, this will be my first project on GitHub so try be nice ;) pretty nervous about sharing my code :D

I learned Python in 1998, and I used it pretty much daily through my working life. Its connectivity with everything has allowed me to do all kinds of interesting and fun things. When I discovered that the [AxiDraw](http://www.axidraw.com/) pen plotter has a [Python binding](https://github.com/inconvergent/axidraw-xy), I decided to try writing in my own handwriting with my own pen. Something I've been unable to do for years.

It has taken a lot, mostly because I can't type, so I've been limited to voice recognition and copy and paste, but the letter linked above is where I got to this evening.

I thought I would share my mini triumph.

I've learned and programmed in a lot of different languages over the years. I have written several languages myself. And even though Python wasn't my first language, it is the first language I consider for any new project. I'd have to have a compelling reason to use something else. So thank you, Python, for making this possible.

&lt;/ shameless preaching to the choir&gt; ;)

316,"Hello!

I finally published my updated version of **Python regular expressions** ebook. My initial motivation was to add **epub** format and separate out **third-party regex** module content into a separate chapter. An email exchange with a reader, a look at feedback from the past year and my own improvements as a writer resulted in a significant overhaul. It took me about 6 weeks to complete the revision instead of 1-2 weeks that I estimated. Sounds familiar right? I’m definitely pleased with the changes, but along the way I added a long list of TODOs that will probably need months of work. Future me is not going to be pleased.

To get pdf/epub versions, use any of these links:

* https://gumroad.com/l/py_regex
* https://leanpub.com/py_regex

As a bundle (Python/Ruby/JS regex and grep/sed/awk cli tools):

* https://gumroad.com/l/regex
* https://leanpub.com/b/regex

I made **all my books free** at the end of March when the pandemic hit my country. The virus doesn’t seem to be going away anytime soon, so I’ll probably start charging again after I finish updating the Ruby and JS regex books. You can still pay if you wish.

You can read the entire book from the GitHub repo - https://github.com/learnbyexample/py_regular_expressions. The repo also contains the code snippets used in the book and a handy way to access all the exercises in a single file. You can also find the solutions there. 

**Edit (Aug 2020):** Web version of the book - https://learnbyexample.github.io/py_regular_expressions/

320,"With type hints, secondary tooling like the `typing` module, and really good inspectors like Pyright already available, a strongly typed dialect of python is definitely coming. Just like the JavaScript world is heavily adopting their version of the same in TypeScript, the new dialect will likely have a new name.

Here’s the issue: the name that keeps getting floated is ‘Typed Python’. Forgive me, but that name sucks and has no character. A language invented while Clinton was President by a guy with one of the 3 coolest first names you can have, and named after a sketch comedy show deserves better than this.

Thus, I would like to propose a simpler name; one that is more ‘pythonic’ if you will. If we just exchange the positions of the “P” and the “T” we evoke the same idea (in addition to making it wonderfully Google-able) and get the name:

335,"By default, Python supports neither pre-increments (like `++x`) nor post-increments (like `x++`), commonly used in other languages. However, the first ones are *syntactically correct* since Python parses them as two subsequent `+x` operations, where `+` is the unary plus operator (same with `--x` and the unary minus). They both have no effect, since in practice `-(-x) == +(+x) == x`.

I'd like to share the [plusplus](https://github.com/borzunov/plusplus) module that turns the `++x`\-like expressions into `x += 1` at the bytecode level, using pure Python only.

Unlike `x += 1`, `++x` is still an expression, so the increments work fine inside other expressions, `if`/`while` conditions, lambda functions, and list/dict comprehensions:

    array[++index] = new_value
    
    if --connection.num_users == 0:
        connection.close()
    
    button.add_click_callback(lambda: ++counter)
    
    index = 0
    indexed_cells = {++index: cell for row in table for cell in row}

**Note:** I don't claim that allowing increments is good for real projects (it may confuse new developers and give opportunities to write less readable code), though some situations when they simplify the code do exist. I've made this module for fun, as a demonstration of Python flexibility and bytecode manipulation techniques.

The module works by replacing the bytecode patterns corresponding to the `++x` and `--x` expressions with the bytecode for actual incrementing. For example, this is what happens for the `y = ++x` line:

[Two consecutive UNARY\_POSITIVE instructions are replaced with adding one and storing the result back to the original place](https://preview.redd.it/2k692gaulan71.png?width=821&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b440b0cf9bc2bae5a2695f1831a810f0d5f55d4)

It's not always that simple: incrementing object attributes and collection items requires much trickier bytecode manipulation (see the [""How it works""](https://github.com/borzunov/plusplus#how-it-works) section in the docs for details).

To use the module, you can just run `pip install plusplus` and add two lines of code enabling the increments. You may do this for just one function or for the whole package you're working on (see the [""How to use it?""](https://github.com/borzunov/plusplus#how-to-use-it) section).

**Updates:**

* The same approach could be used to implement the assignment expressions for the Python versions that don't support them. For example, we could replace the `x &lt;-- value` expressions (two unary minuses + one comparison) with actual assignments (setting `x` to `value`).
* See also [cpmoptimize](https://kukuruku.co/post/automatic-algorithms-optimization-via-fast-matrix-exponentiation/) \- my older project about Python bytecode manipulation.

For this reason I implemented this basic packet sniffer using just built-in libraries and fully compatible with Python 3.x. It is implemented in OOP, leverages libraries like ctypes, socket, argparse and others and relies on the use of abstract base classes, inheritance, special methods, decorators and design patterns (command, observer and  template). We also employ some manipulation of binary and hexadecimal values that are formatted for the use on raw sockets.

This tool is part of an upcoming (though not nearly ready) series of video tutorials I plan to launch some time in the next year. It might be a rather long course given how much we'd need to cover about all the underlying networking and programming topics.

## Introduction

JustPy is an object-oriented, component based, high-level Python Web Framework that requires no front-end programming. With a few lines of only Python code, you can create interactive websites without any JavaScript programming.

Unlike other web frameworks, JustPy has no front-end/back-end distinction. All programming is done on the back-end allowing a simpler, more productive, and more Pythonic web development experience. JustPy removes the front-end/back-end distinction by intercepting the relevant events on the front-end and sending them to the back-end to be processed.

In JustPy, elements on the web page are instances of component classes. A component in JustPy is a Python class that allows you to instantiate reusable custom elements whose functionality and design is encapsulated away from the rest of your code.

Custom components can be created using other components as building blocks. Out of the box, JustPy comes with support for [HTML](https://justpy.io/#/tutorial/html_components) and [SVG](https://justpy.io/#/tutorial/svg_components) components as well as more complex components such as [charts](https://justpy.io/#/charts_tutorial/introduction) and [grids](https://justpy.io/#/grids_tutorial/introduction).  It also supports most of the components and the functionality of the [Quasar](https://quasar.dev/) library of [Material Design 2.0](https://material.io/) components.

JustPy encourages creating your own components and reusing them in different projects (and, if applicable, sharing these components with others).

JustPy supports visualization using [matplotlib](https://justpy.io/#/tutorial/matplotlib) and [Highcharts](https://justpy.io/#/charts_tutorial/introduction).

JustPy integrates nicely with [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and simplifies building web sites based on pandas analysis. JustPy comes with a [pandas extension](https://justpy.io/#/charts_tutorial/pandas?id=using-the-pandas-extension) that makes it simple to create interactive charts and grids from pandas data structures.

## Hello World!

    import justpy as jp
    
    def hello_world():
        wp = jp.WebPage()
        d = jp.Div(text='Hello world!')
        wp.add(d)
        return wp
        
    jp.justpy(hello_world)

The program above activates a web server that returns a web page with 'Hello world!' for any request. Locally, you would direct your browser to [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) or http://localhost:8000/ or  to see the result.

Here is a slightly modified version in which 'Hello world!' changes to 'I was clicked!' when it is clicked.

    import justpy as jp
    
    def my_click(self, msg):
        self.text = 'I was clicked!'
    
    def hello_world():
        wp = jp.WebPage()
        d = jp.Div(text='Hello world!')
        d.on('click', my_click)
        wp.add(d)
        return wp
    
    jp.justpy(hello_world)

Many other examples can be found in the [tutorial](https://justpy.io/#/tutorial/getting_started)

## Under the Hood

JustPy's backend is built using:

* [starlette](https://www.starlette.io/) \- ""a lightweight [ASGI](https://asgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) framework/toolkit, which is ideal for building high performance asyncio services"".
* [uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/) \- ""a lightning-fast [ASGI](https://asgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) server, built on [uvloop](https://github.com/MagicStack/uvloop) and [httptools](https://github.com/MagicStack/httptools)"".

JustPy's frontend (which is transparent to JustPy developers) is built using:

* [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) \- ""The Progressive JavaScript Framework""

The way JustPy removes the frontend/backend distinction is by intercepting the relevant events on the frontend and sending them to the backend to be processed.

360,"*(TLDR at the bottom)*

**THE SITUATION**

My son came into the world last month and, as first time parents, we've had a hard time handling his hectic feeding schedule. He would burst into screams, and we'd scramble to get a bottle prepared/warmed. However there wasn't a very good way to know how much milk to warm (once you heat it, it has to be either consumed or discarded). And since a bottle takes 5+ minutes to heat up, we'd spend that time fumbling to soothe him until it was ready. After one-to-two weeks of this, I decided to do something about it.

That's why I created a Python project to take out the guesswork! From the beginning, we were logging all of his feeds because we wanted to make sure he was eating enough (and wasn't eating too much). We use a shared Google Keep note because that's the easiest/quickest way to do it on our phones. And since we'd already gotten into the habit of logging data, I figured 'why not use it to predict when the next bottle will be demanded?'

**WHAT IT DOES**

The program scrapes all of the content from the Google Keep note and then uses it to estimate the next feed. This estimation includes not only the time, but also the quantity of milk to prepare. It's based on the patterns exhibited over the prior three days, and takes into account both his bottle feeds and his direct breastfeeds. My original goal was to create a legitimate predictive model of his feed patterns, but it quickly became apparent that an explicit model wouldn't be the best strategy (largely due to the irregularity of the feed time data points).

Once it has crunched the data, the program emails both of us with the outputs. Each email contains two distinct sections: the estimates and the summary. The estimates are the metrics related to the next anticipated bottle (feed time and milk quantity) and they've been pretty accurate so far. The summary includes things like average total daily intake / average feed size / average time between feeds / etc. It's just something I threw in to give us some trending insight, but it's turned out to be immensely helpful -- particularly when answering questions at the pediatrician's office.

**ADMIN/SETUP**

The program is 100% Python, but it does include some non-standard libraries: gkeepapi and pandas. Unfortunately, Google doesn't support API access for Google Keep (why not??) and we weren't willing to change the way we log data. But luckily [gkeepapi](https://github.com/kiwiz/gkeepapi) exists, and that has proven to work great. The downside is that frequently accessing the Keep note through unofficial means caused Google to regularly prompt me to verify my account activity, which got *very* old *very* quickly. To mitigate that, I added a feature in the program to only check the note when there's likely to be new information there. Since adding that, Google has stopped bugging me about it.

Using Launchd, I've scheduled the program to run every ten minutes. It can obviously be run manually as well, but it can be run as often as desired. Even if it's run very frequently, it won't access the Keep note or send an email unless there's likely to be new data to consider.

One goal for this project was that the Google Keep note wouldn't have to change formats from what we'd been doing from the start (we wanted to keep formatting the note lines in the way that was easiest/most intuitive for us). As a result, the format which will allow the program to interpret dates/times/quantities is somewhat rigid. Anyone who uses the program will need to emulate our log style or rewrite the code which extracts data. Another goal for the project was that I'd get some pandas practice in. I admit that pandas was likely overkill for this application, but I wanted to get some experience using it and this project has definitely helped me with the basics.

**NOTES**

The mins/maxes for the time between feeds and the quantities of milk are based on standards for the baby's age (stored in age\_info.txt). My son has been fairly consistent/normal with his feeds, so the generally accepted mins/maxes work just fine. But if -- for example -- a baby wanted to eat every hour, the minimum milk quantity per feed would probably be too much.

Since I made this project for my own use and don't really expect other people to use it, there are some hardcoded values. Nothing major -- just people's names for the email, and the note ID for accessing the Google Keep note.

367,"So this just happened today. I've been learning Python on and off for a long time. I had to take a couple of classes for my undergrad a couple years back, and after that, I never really needed to apply it in my job.

Fast forward to today, my manager was complaining about how many requests for test data the business team was giving him. He tasked me with helping him generate the data using Excel and advanced SQL logic.

I decided to dust off my rusty Python scripting knowledge and created a script that automated the entire process. It took many hours, a lot of googling and 2 mugs of coffee, but I accomplished what I set out to do. My script was able to generate nearly 5000 queries in less than a minute.

Needless to say, my boss was impressed by my initiative, and I've found out first hand how useful knowing Python is. I want to thank this subreddit for being so supportive and always promoting new learning resources. Automate the Boring Stuff is a gold mine of info and I am more motivated than ever before to expand my skills and knowledge!

**Edit:** Wow! I never really expected this post to blow up like it did. Thank you all for the awards. Never really gotten any of them before, as I mostly lurk and don't post. Yesterday was an anomaly because I just felt grateful for subs like this one. I just wanted to take the time to clarify some things.

To those people who are worried about my boss' reaction, don't be. I am extremely lucky to have a boss who cares for all his employees (even me, the part timer with very little IT experience). To give a bit of background, he and my father are friends, so he's taken me under his wing, teaching me how to handle myself in a professional environment and helping my career by exposing me to new opportunities within the project we 're working on. Needless to say, over the past few months, I've been assigned many different tasks on both the business and engineering side, learning a lot in the process that will be invaluable to my career in the future.

Regarding an increase in pay, I've put in the paperwork to go full time, and I gained his approval a few weeks back because of how much effort I put in to making sure I completed my tasks to the best of my abilities. I think this ensured that he would back me up 100% if anyone tried to object. Hopefully by the beginning of October, I'll be billing for 40 hours instead of 24.

I love the team and company I work for, as everyone is super friendly and willing to help me out. Also, part of the reason I automated this task was because it helps my boss politically. I'm not too well-versed in office politics, but he's been giving me lessons on how to handle it. By being able to provide thousands of data points for the business team, he now has them on the back foot and they have to work hard to fulfill their end of the testing, otherwise they're going to be the ones with egg on their face if the issue gets escalated to the executive levels.

I only had two mugs of coffee because my mom yelled at me for drinking coffee late at night and banned me from the kitchen. :D

Classifying these web pages on the internet is a very important aspect to provide the user with a safe browsing experience.   


The objective of this project is to classify the web pages into two categories *Malicious\[Bad\]* and *Benign\[Good\]*  webpages.  Exploratory Data Analysis and Geospatial Data Analysis are done to get more insights and knowledge about the data. Features are engineered and the data is preprocessed accordingly. A total of four ML  and DL models are trained. The models are **XGBoost**, **Logistic Regression**, **Decision Tree** and **Deep Neural Network**. The DNN is implemented in PyTorch and the others are implemented using scikit learn.

403,"Thought this was funny. I work as an Accountant and last week my Manager let me know that due to a Government audit we would be required to fully itemise our government funding client statements. 

The problem is that our client statement involve charges from third party companies who are paid from this government funding and all these invoices are held on a third party website. 

The third party website said they couldn't help and it was determined that due to how slow the website is as well as other factors (the invoices are all listed as individual download links, some invoices are password protected pdf's, some are jpg's, the website layout is terrible) that it would require 160-180 hours of manual work and therefore a new admin person would need to be hired.

So I wrote something in Python that opens a headless browser, grabs all client names, then goes through each clients account and downloads every invoice, skips any client with no invoices, converts all jpg's to pdf's and resizes them so they fit correctly on the page and merges all invoices into one file per client to form our new statement file.

It takes about about an hour to create 800 statements from 6000 invoices, about half of that time being due to how slow the website is but I'm pretty happy with it and it can now do in a lunch break what we were preparing to hire an entirely new person to do.

I'm still a beginner with Python but I feel like this was a good step in the right direction.

This did make me wonder though, how is it that jobs that are almost fully admin and could be automated are still so common.

427,"I am doing a PSA:

Please be extra careful when you see Kite (the program auto-completor app). This app is atrociously bad for performance, it  spreads to all of your system (and I mean ALL of your system), and the developers intentionally made it hard for you to remove it. I made the mistake of installing it when I was trying out Spyder IDE. I didn't realize this app installed itself across all of my editors, including neovim. I started noticing that my neovim would get several seconds of hiccup when I was running  python REPL, which had never happened before. Soon my Linux system started experiencing severe hiccup as well. Then I did some profiling and found out that Kite was making background process calls without my consent. The  worst part yet is they made it nearly impossible for you uninstall it, not unless you download their shady app manager or make a curl call to a completely unknown api server just to uninstall apps on your computer. I don't even want to know what kind of personal information / data that they were stealing from my computer. I fail to see how Kite is different from a virus. Please use extra caution when going through IDE setup as something like Kite can easily creep in and contaminate your whole system just like that. To the developers of Spyder and VSCode and other IDEs, please take active step in banning an app like Kite that severely infringes upon the privacy and right of their users. By promoting this app as an extension, you are potentially endangering millions of your users!

EDIT on 9/13/2021:

I wanted to attach my comment response to juliusc (maintainer of Spyder) to the main post, as it echoes my core concerns. I want to thank juliusc for responding to this post.

**Hi juliusc,**

**First of all, I want to thank you for engaging this post and responding to my concerns. I took some time to collect my thoughts and just wanted to share them with you and other developers of popular development tools like Spyder, VSCode, Atom etc. By no means am I trying to single out Spyder, and I want you to know that I deeply appreciate all the work that you guys have done to empower everyone by democratizing better development tools.**

**I would like to point out though, that there was nothing ""light"" about the promotion of Kite in Spyder. As me and other users have noted, Kite installation during the initialization setup of Spyder was an opt-out by default. I am sure many people either clicked through the setup and installed Kite without reading the ""fine-prints"" as is totally reasonable for an average user, and/or they mistakenly assumed that Kite is a safe and secure plugin that had been vetted by the Spyder developers, as it's one of the first things that you see when you start using Spyder. Without sounding accusatory, I was very disappointed that the Spyder developers allowed this to happen. Since I haven't been monitoring your git tracker issues related to Kite (because frankly it's not my job), I will take your word for it that not many Spyder users raised my concern. But anyone who just googles Kite will quickly discover that Kite had severe security/privacy concerns, was an invasive software, and its company conducted extremely questionable business practices in other open source packages as far back as 2017. In fact, the very same announcement post of Kite's sponsorship of Spyder in 2019 already had several users that raised their concerns in the comments section (**[**https://www.spyder-ide.org/blog/spyder-kite-funding/**](https://www.spyder-ide.org/blog/spyder-kite-funding/)**). I don't think it's fair to say that well since the users didn't find any issue and complained about them on git, then we will let it slide. I get that you guys are maintaining/developing Spyder for all of us for free, but I also uphold you to a higher standard because a single bad commit or decision by you can lead to disproportional effects on the rest of us. And sometimes these effects take a while for us to find out and may have irreversible and disastrous consequences. I truly beseech you to be truthful with us and with yourselves, whether if corporate sponsorship, financial or otherwise, means that you can lower the standard that you hold for software integration, even if it comes at the cost of your users. Because if that is the case, then it's a slippery slope to the end of free and open source development as we know it.**

Ultimate Python study guide for newcomers and professionals alike. 🐍 🐍 🐍

    print(""Ultimate Python study guide"")

I created a GitHub repo to share what I've learned about [core Python](https://www.python.org/) over the past 5+ years of using it as a college graduate, an employee at large-scale companies and an open-source contributor of repositories like [Celery](https://github.com/celery/celery) and [Full Stack Python](https://github.com/mattmakai/fullstackpython.com). I look forward to seeing more people learn Python and pursue their passions through it. 🎓

Here are the primary goals of creating this guide:

🏆 **Serve as a resource** for Python newcomers who prefer to learn hands-on. This repository has a collection of standalone modules which can be run in an IDE like [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) and in the browser like [Repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/python3). Even a plain old terminal will work with the examples. Most lines have carefully crafted comments which guide a reader through what the programs are doing step-by-step. Users are encouraged to modify source code anywhere as long as the mainroutines are not deleted and [run successfully](https://github.com/huangsam/ultimate-python/blob/master/runner.py) after each change.

🏆 **Serve as a pure guide** for those who want to revisit core Python concepts. Only [builtin libraries](https://docs.python.org/3/library/) are leveraged so that these concepts can be conveyed without the overhead of domain-specific concepts. As such, popular open-source libraries and frameworks are not installed. However, reading the source code in these frameworks is inspiring and highly encouraged if your goal is to become a true [Pythonista](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=pythonista).",inllmf,Reddit - r/Python

Among a lot of new additions I would say that one of the greatest updates that came is improvement of error messages. Not only are they now much better at locating the error, they are now even more descriptive. And what's cooler is that they are now also suggestive. 

Example:

if x = 2

Earlier: SyntaxError: invalid syntax

Now: SyntaxError: cannot assign to attribute here. Maybe you meant ""=="" instead of ""=""?


And it would even try to see if there is a similarly named variables, if you typed in wrong name. 

Example (from notes):

\&gt;\&gt;\&gt; schwarzschild_black_hole = None

\&gt;\&gt;\&gt; schwarschild_black_hole

... NameError: name 'schwarschild_black_hole' is not defined. Did you mean: schwarzschild_black_hole?

If you like stocks and are careful with the way you spend your money, (me saying it seems counter-intuitive given that I bought GME at the peak, I know) you know how much time goes into buying shares of a stock.

You need to: Find stocks that are somehow undervalued; Research on the company, and its competitors; Check that the financials are healthy; Look into different technical indicators; Investigate SEC fillings and Insider activity; Look up for next earnings date and analysts estimates; Estimate market’s sentiment through Reddit, Twitter, Stocktwits; Read news;. … the list goes on.

It’s tedious and I don’t have 24k for a Bloomberg terminal. Which led me to the idea during xmas break to spend the time creating my own terminal. I introduce you to “Gamestonk Terminal” (probably should’ve sent 1 tweet everyday to Elon Musk for copyrights permission eheh).

As someone mentioned, this is meant to be like a swiss army knife for finance. It contains the following functionalities:

* **Discover Stocks:** Some features are: Top gainers; Sectors performance; upcoming earnings releases; top high shorted interest stocks; top stocks with low float; top orders on fidelity; and some SPAC websites with news/calendars.
* **Market Sentiment:** Main features are: Scrolling through Reddit main posts, and most tickers mentions; Extracting trending symbols on stocktwits, or even stocktwit sentiment based on bull/bear flags; Twitter in-depth sentiment prediction using AI; Google mentions over time.
* **Research Web pages:** List of good pages to do research on a stock, e.g. macroaxis, zacks, macrotrends, ..
* **Fundamental Analysis:** Read financials from a company from Market Watch, Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, and Financial Modeling Prep API. Since I only rely on free data, I added the information from all of these, so that the user can get it from the source it trusts the most. Also exports management team behind stock, along with their pages on Google, to speed up research process.
* **Technical Analysis:** The usual technical indicators: sma, rsi, macd, adx, bbands, and more.
* **Due Diligence:** It has several features that I found to be really useful. Some of them are: Latest news of the company; Analyst prices and ratings; Price target from several analysts plot over time vs stock price; Insider activity, and these timestamps marked on the stock price historical data; Latest SEC fillings; Short interest over time; A check for financial warnings based on Sean Seah book.
* **Prediction Techniques:** The one I had more fun with. It tries to predict the stock price, from simple models like sma and arima to complex neural network models, like LSTM. The additional capability here is that all of these are easy to configure. Either through command line arguments, or even in form of a configuration file to define your NN.
* **Reports**: Allows you to run several jobs functionalities and write daily notes on a stock, so that you can assess what you thought about the stock in the past, to perform better decisions.
* **Comparison Analysis**: Allows you to compare stocks.
* **On the ROADMAP**: Cryptocurrencies, Portfolio Analysis, Credit Analysis. Feel free to add the features you'd like and we would happily work on it.

NOTE: This project will always remain open-source, and the idea is that it can grow substantially over-time so that more and more people start taking advantage of it.

I hope you find this useful, and even contribute to the project! The installation guidelines are in a much better state now, so it should be much easier to install and play with it.

Thanks!

452,"Hello all

I asked you people if you are interested in learning Python by writing a Reddit bot some time back on r/learnprogramming. I received immense number of responses, so I'm posting it on r/python. It covers the process, practices and tools involved in writing a Reddit bot in Python.

Please post your feedback and questions in comments, and I'll be happy to answer them.

#**Requirements**:

1. You are somewhat familiar with programming in general, and have an idea about Python or other languages (like what are variables etc)
2. You  are on a Unix-like system with access to command line tools
3. Familiarity with [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Github](https://github.com/) (Not really required...it is better if you are familiar)
4. A Reddit account

Even if you don't meet these requirements...no need to worry!

#**Introduction**

Writing a bot for Reddit is easier than you think, because Reddit provides a structured method to access its data via the [Reddit API](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api). There are amazing tools like [PRAW](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) which can help simplify the process. PRAW is a Python wrapper for Reddit, and it takes the pain out of the process of writing a bot.


And as I said earlier, Python is an great language, which is easy to grasp for beginners. What even more amazing is it's community, which has made incredible open-source tools and libraries for almost anything. We will be using some of those, and you will realise how useful they are!

#**Important information - Please read**

1. While this post will cover a variety of programming topics, I highly encourage you to explore more. Go ahead and read the documentation of libraries used and think about how can you improve something in your project. I will possibly add more topics to this post.

2. Please **DO NOT CREATE SPAM** by letting your bot run on all of Reddit before you have thoroughly tested it. **r/test** exists for you to do all sorts of testing with your bot...please use it. Refer to [botiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/bottiquette) and keeping in mind the type of bot you create, comply with the guidelines.

#**The code and resources**

I jus wrote a bot for Reddit, which posts a textual explanation of the popular webcomic [xkcd](https://www.xkcd.com) whenever it encounters an xkcd link. It is named **explainxkcdbot**. As of now, I have set my bot to run on r/test only to let you people test it all you want.


You can find the complete source code on my Github page - 
**https://github.com/aydwi/explainxkcdbot**

Here is the code for the bot -
**https://github.com/aydwi/explainxkcdbot/blob/master/explainxkcdbot.py**


#**How to run the bot**

The process is given here - https://github.com/aydwi/explainxkcdbot/blob/master/README.md

If you have any problems in running the bot, please let me know in the comments.


#**Let us begin**

We will move forward step-by-step in the code, and see what is going on.

##Section 1 - Importing libraries


https://gist.github.com/aydwi/e5e4f294b66adf1cb025a70a0392f847


This is the beginning of the program. Any line which begins with a `#` sign is a comment in Python, so it is not interpreted as code. Then we import the essential libraries required for out program. These libraries contain the methods (or functions) which we will use throughout our program. The syntax is pretty straightforward. Next we see 3 variables with some values assigned to them. More on them later.


##Section 2 - Authenticating


https://gist.github.com/aydwi/b941d04d8128e415d6630e961cc97988


This is where important things begin. Before proceeding, you should have a basic idea of what are **[classes](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html)** and **[methods](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3786881/what-is-a-method-in-python)** in Python. One more important thing is an **object** - it is an instance of class, which holds the data variables declared in class and the **member functions work on these objects**. Please make a comment if you do not understand, I will try to explain.


`def authenticate():` defines a function which will try to authenticate the bot to Reddit. This is where PRAW comes into play as it provides us methods to do this. Remember we created a *praw.ini* file earlier. It is a configuration file that stores authentication credentials, so that you just call it whenever needed.


Next, we pass authentication parameters to `praw.Reddit()`. Here `explainbot` refers to the credentials in the configuration file, and `user_agent` is a descriptive string about your script/bot. This returns a [Reddit instance](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code_overview/reddit_instance.html), which we assign to the variable `reddit`, and use this variable whenever we wish to authenticate.


Next up, we make a print statement to see who is getting authenticated i.e. the name. The `user` class in PRAW provides methods for the currently authenticated user. We call the method `me()` on `user` and then call it on the variable holding the Reddit instance for authentication, which in our case is `reddit`. So the statement becomes `reddit.user.me()`. We just use some [formatting in python](https://pyformat.info/) to print it.


Finally we `return` the variable `reddit`. Now i can use this `authenticate()` function in my program by calling it when I need it, and it will give me the variable `reddit`, which stores the Reddit instance.

------------------------------

**Important note 1:** Why did I create a function? It is because creating functions makes us easy to manage out code. We write separate functions for separate features of the program, and call them wherever needed. This breaks the code into manageable chunks, which makes it easy to read, modify and debug.

------------------------------

##Section 3 - Scraping


https://gist.github.com/aydwi/699123424e7b38da19d62e69339e859c


Next up is the function `def fetchdata(url)`. Notice how this function takes a parameter `url`. We pass this parameter whenever we call this function. The purpose of this function is to scrape/gather the data from the web, in order to post an explanation.


**Now scraping is not a very reliable process**, but sometimes we just have to do it. We go to a website, go through it's HTML source, and extract the text, links etc. that we want. Here we use **[Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/quickstart/#make-a-request)** library to make a web request, and **[Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/)** to extract the data.


`r = requests.get(url)` gives a Response object called `r`. We can get all the information we need from this object. Then we call the method `content` on `r`, and pass it to `soup = BeautifulSoup(r.content, 'html.parser')`, which gives us a `soup` object with which we can retrieve elements of a web page. Read more [here](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/).


Now what happens depends on what are you scraping. Every website has different type of content, and you should go through the HTML to see how can you retrieve what you want. In my case http://explainxkcd.com has it's explanation inside the first few `&lt;p&gt;` tags, so I look for the first `&lt;p&gt;` tag by `tag = soup.find('p')`. Also, immediately after the explanation ends, `&lt;h2&gt;` tag follows, so I know where to stop. Now take a look here-

    while True:
        if isinstance(tag, bs4.element.Tag):
            if tag.name == 'h2':
                break
            if tag.name == 'h3':
                tag = tag.nextSibling
            else:
                data = data + '\n' + tag.text
                tag = tag.nextSibling
        else:
            tag = tag.nextSibling

I continue to look through the tags, and store textual data in a `string` named `data` and move to the next tag. I `break` the process if I encounter `&lt;h2&gt;` because I know that is where explanation ends. The code depends on the structure of website you are scraping. Finally, I return `data`, so that now when I call the function like `fetchdata('http://explainxkcd.com/1024')` for example, it returns me the explanation of comic 1024 as a `string` named `data`.

----------------

**Important note 2:** Scraping is unreliable. If the website changes it's structure, you have to change your code. In this case, it can still include some tags which we don't want. The line `if (tag.name == 'h3')` in the above function is for handling one such unexpected situation I encountered on http://explainxkcd.com. This is why we like to have APIs. 

--------------------------


##Section 4 - Using regular expressions, parsing URLs, handling exceptions and preventing duplicate submissions


https://gist.github.com/aydwi/700db3e46770d13fe89356d0fa4f570d


This function which takes a parameter which is a Reddit instance (remember that Reddit instance from Section 1). Again we use PRAW to get one or more subreddits, and go through their comments. See [here](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code_overview/reddit/subreddits.html) and [here](http://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code_overview/models/comment.html).

You can pass multiple subreddits like `for comment in reddit.subreddit('test+learnprogramming+pics')`.

**Regular Expressions**: Now I want to extract xkcd links from the comments, so I need to look for a pattern for the URL. xkcd links are of the form `https://www.xkcd.com/[some number]`. So we make use of regular expressions from the `re` library to match the pattern. [More about regular expressions](https://regexone.com/references/python).

    match = re.findall(""https://www.xkcd.com/[0-9]+"", comment.body)
        if match:
            print(""Link found in comment with comment ID: "" + comment.id)
            xkcd_url = match[0]

Here I look for all strings that are like `https://www.xkcd.com/[some number]` using the method `findall` from [user comments](http://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code_overview/models/comment.html), and if it matches, it returns a list with the matching URL, and we store our URL in the variable `xkcd_url`.

----------------

**Important note 3:** Try to find out regular expressions (regex) to improve this program. What happens if a user posts 'https://xkcd.com/1024' or http version as 'http://www.xkcd.com/1024'. These are still valid xkcd URLs. There can be some other cases where the URL might be placed between a bunch of symbols in a comment. Try to modify the regex statement so that it can detect these cases as well.

--------------------------


**URL parsing**: Now I have an xkcd URL. I have 2 immediate objectives now- 

Objective 1. To extract the comic number at the end of the URL. We use [urllib.parse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.html) for this purpose.

    url_obj = urlparse(xkcd_url)
            xkcd_id = int((url_obj.path.strip(""/"")))

Objective 2. Form a complete **explainxkcd.com** URL, which I will pass as a parameter to the function `fetchdata(url)` (See Section 2)

    myurl = 'http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/' + str(xkcd_id)

Both objectives are thus complete.

**Preventing duplicate submissions and Exception handling**: The bot needs to make sure it replies to every comment only once. There are many methods you can try which include using a separate key-value database like [Memcached](https://memcached.org/), but we will use a simpler approach.


Just create a text file (remember commented.txt), store the comment ID of a comment in it when you  visit a relevant comment, and verify if a comment ID already exists in that file before making new comments. Remember to put the location of the text file in the `path` variable (from Section 1), so that you can pass it to the method `open()`.


Now, what happens when a user makes a comment like 'https://www.xkcd.com/689243348723'. This xkcd does not exist, but the program will extract '689243348723', then form a link like http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/689243348723, and pass it to the function `fetchdata(url)`. Now **the function will return an exception and your program will stop/crash**. You need to take care of these situations.

This is achieved using `try`, `except` and `else` blocks. [See here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html) Here is the code for these 2 steps-

    file_obj_r = open(path,'r')
                        
            try:
                explanation = fetchdata(myurl)
            except:
                print('Exception!!! Possibly incorrect xkcd URL...\n')
                # Typical cause for this will be a URL for an xkcd that does not exist (Example: https://www.xkcd.com/772524318/)
            else:
                if comment.id not in file_obj_r.read().splitlines():
                    print('Link is unique...posting explanation\n')
                    comment.reply(header + explanation + footer)
                    
                    file_obj_r.close()

                    file_obj_w = open(path,'a+')
                    file_obj_w.write(comment.id + '\n')
                    file_obj_w.close()
                else:
                    print('Already visited link...No reply needed\n')


Notice how I make a reply to a relevant comment by using the variables from Section 1 to print header and footer description alongside the explanation - `comment.reply(header + explanation + footer)`


Next we make some `sleep` statements to stop the bot from querying Reddit too fast. If the Reddit API returns an error due to too many requests, adjust `val` in the instances of `time.sleep(val)` in your program.


##Section 5: The main function


https://gist.github.com/aydwi/99323ebd710428f4590077a844236f83


We are almost done here. We wrap our functions into a `main` function by calling `authenticate()` (remember Section 1) and passing it to the function which runs the bot, namely `run_explainbot(reddit)`. Since we are calling it inside `while` loop with the expression 'True', it will run indefinitely.


#My bot in action


Test post to show the bot in action: https://redd.it/6tey71 (Since I'm not running it continuously as of now, it won't reply to every comment containing an xkcd link there)

**Finally, if you want to take this project further, you are welcome to contribute code to [my Github repository](https://github.com/aydwi/explainxkcdbot). You can fork it (please note that there are still some checks to be added in order to make the bot more Reddit friendly) or open a pull request.** I'll try to add more details about file handling and scraping aspects of the program once I get some time.

[Hosted version](https://getquantbase.com) (how to actually run/invest in it). Folks the amount of y’all that have messaged me asking for this is absolutely AMAZING but I can’t keep up! Posting the link here for you guys

&amp;#x200B;

HOW I DID THIS

Scraped WSB sentiment, got the top + most positively mentioned stocks on WSB (for the better part of this year, that's been $GME and $AMC, recently some $SPCE and $NVDA, and about 13 other stocks. I have the strategy rebalancing monthly. The source code is actually pretty intuitive, but essentially what it uses is VADER ( Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning), which s a model used for text sentiment analysis that is sensitive to both polarity (positive/negative) and intensity (strength) of emotion.

The way it works is by relying on a dictionary that maps lexical (aka word-based) features to emotion intensities -- these are known as sentiment scores. The overall sentiment score of a comment/post is achieved by summing up the intensity of each word in the text.

In some ways, it's easy: words like ‘love’, ‘enjoy’, ‘happy’, ‘like’ all convey a positive sentiment. Also VADER is smart enough to understand the basic context of these words, such as “did not love” as a negative statement. It also understands the emphasis of capitalization and punctuation, such as “ENJOY” which is pretty cool. Phrases like “The acting was good , but the movie could have been better” have sentiments in both polarities, which makes this kind of analysis tricky -- essentially w VADER you would analyze which part of the sentiment here is more intense.

&amp;#x200B;

**Results and some stats:**

Right now I'm up 60% YTD, compared to the SP500's 13% (the recent spikes in GME and AMC have helped tremendously)

\- The strategy is **backtested** only to the beginning of 2020, but I'm working on it. It's got an annualized return of 33% (compared to 16% for the SP500)

\- **Max drawdown of -8.7%** (aka how far it went down before coming back up -- interestingly enough, WallStreetBets weathered COVID pretty well)

465,"6 months ago I’d never written a single line of code, in any language. I decided completely out of the blue to do a course on “coding for data analysis”, I very nearly picked one on human biology instead. It was just something to fill the lockdown boredom, but I quickly and unexpectedly started to enjoy it more and more.

Fast forward 3 months and I started learning html and then django. From that the idea to create www.rugbykickoff.com, which has just gone live now. 

I honestly can’t believe how quickly it was to pick the language up with the amount of help available online. 

I lost motivation several times getting completely lost at stack overflow answers where I didn’t understand a single concept etc. But this is testament to persevering and the massive amount of online support that’s available.

I  am a self-taught Analytics professional from a small town in India. I  am a long time lurker here on Reddit and I finally have something to  share with this community.

I have  extensive experience in Python and Machine Learning working in companies  like Citi Bank and Flipkart (a Walmart's subsidiary in India). I have  created a small Python course all inside Jupyter Notebook. All you need  to do is to import the notebook files and you can learn the topics and  run the codes - all inside the notebook file itself. I believe that  these notebooks will be more than enough for you to get started in  Python and you might not need to do any other basic Python course  online.

Jupyter Notebook files are available [here](https://github.com/ItsAwSM/Python-for-Data-Analytics).

I also have created videos on the notebooks if you need any added explanation. They are on my channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/c/UtsavAwasthiX/videos)

513,"So, here's what I'm doing and why I'm doing it.

I've been a high school Computer Science teacher for over 10 years (like 11ish but who's counting at this point...)

I have always taught kids in my room but I started teaching an AP Computer Science course in java virtually two years ago. This was all fine and good but I got interested in providing my own a-synchronous resources for my students to make learning virtually more accessible. Fast forward a year and we've convinced my district that if I can make video series for students to learn introduction programming then it will help non-trained teachers offer these courses to students at smaller rural schools where there are less course offerings.

That triggered me getting to produce my Arduino course. Then this year, expedited by the pandemic and the need for virtual resources, I got to build my Python course. Next up is building a full Java course that hits on everything in the AP Computer Science A curriculum.

I know there's a million resources out there and I was doing it for my district and my students, but I figured if I'm going to be doing it anyway, I might as well share it with a broader audience. So, with permission, I ""branded"" the content and published it all on YouTube.

Anyway, from one CS teacher to a bunch of humans trying to learn how to code: I hope it's helpful.

&amp;#x200B;

1. [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)  \- One of the most renowned and recommended books for complete beginners to programming. Suggested for newer and medium programmers equally.
2. [Official Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) \- As said by many experienced programmers, the best way to learn any language is to go over the official documentation once. No tutorial can go over all the syntax and libraries in Python. So, for thorough understanding of Python, this is the way to go.
3. [FreeCodeCamp Tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/python-for-everybody/introduction-why-program) \- This is one of the most popular sites with 300+ hours of experienced teaching for free along with a Course Completion Certificate which you can use for your CVV, all for free.
4. [SoloLearn Courses](https://www.sololearn.com/learning) \- This site is pretty basic and contains MCQ questions and a single programming question after one module. It has Python For Beginners, Python For Intermediates, Python Core and Python for Data Science. Overall recommended for beginners.
5. [FreeCodeCamp X Giraffe Academy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw&amp;vl=en) \- One of the best one's out there to get a kick start with Python. Teaches you all the basic recommended Syntax and explains them well too, unlike other's doesn't just make you copy paste code.
6. [Telusko](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsyeobzWxl7poL9JTVyndKe62ieoN-MZ3) \- Not as popular or renowned as the other tutorials recommended above, but still worth watching.
7. [Cheat Sheet](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python/) \- Not exactly a tutorial, it's a cheat sheet with all the essential syntax and their explanations.
8. [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) \- This is also not a tutorial. This is a place where you can ask your questions regarding Python. But please, before asking questions on Reddit or Stack Overflow, check your code twice or thrice and then google it. Even after that, if you can't solve the problem, send your question on Reddit and/or Stack Overflow.

**None of the above tutorials and information is mine** and is the property of their respective owners. I have just made a list so as to help other users trying to learn Python.

If you think I have left any other important links, please tell me and I will be more that happy to add them. My discord: doughnut#3968.

I generally just tinker around keeping the basics fresh, but recently I had an opportunity to speed up some data analysis at work, and was able to use python to do it!

As part of our testing, we generate some large csv files (generally 1-4 gb), which were a real pain in the ass to work with in excel. Using python and pandas, I wrote a short piece of code (200 lines) to parse our data, strip out the junk, and plot it into a presentable form. Now there are like 5 people using it on a regular basis!

So the algorithm is essentially listening to price changes in the last 5 minutes for all the coins on Binance. Once it detects that some coins have moved by more than 3% in the last 5 minutes, it takes this as a strong bullish signal and places a trade.

The algo is also able to store each bought coin in a local file and to track the performance of each trade placed so that it can perform stop loss and take profit actions and sell the coins that reach those thresholds.

Here's a more in-depth look at the bot parameters:

1. By default we’re only picking USDT pairs
2. We’re excluding Margin (like BTCDOWNUSDT) and Fiat pairs
3. The bot checks if the any coin has gone up by more than 3% in the last 5 minutes
4. The bot will buy 100 USDT of the most volatile coins on Binance
5. The bot will sell at 6% profit or 3% stop loss

Anyway, here's the source code if you're comfortable with Python:

563,"snakeware is a new Linux-based operating system with a fully Python userspace. Our window manager is based on pygame\_gui. We do not use X11, we draw directly to the framebuffer. We also do not use systemd or any of the other huge and typical GNU/Linux utilities, because they are very opaque and not fun for recreational programmers to contribute to.

Our distro boots directly into a Python environment, where you can then do whatever you want with your computer. It's being designed based on the spirit of the Commodore 64, which is primarily that computing should be simple and fun. snakeware is still early in development, but we would like to welcome more contributors as the project grows (both in the Python space and in the build/packaging process for the actual distro).

I wrote a python script that can help anyone who wants to study a foreign language to get full language courses for various levels for FREE.

The script is a scraper I wrote since I wanted to save some courses and material from Japanesepod101 to listen to on my phone, but I ended up making it global for almost any language.

Few points regarding the script:

1. I've noticed there are some other similar scrapers that rely on selenium but they are buggy and fragile. I like selenium as a tool, but I find it often times unnecessarily misused when simple POST/GET requests could get the same job done more eloquently, that's why I went with beautifulSoup.
2. Currently the script is only downloading mp3s (since that's what I originally intended to do) but I  plan on adding PDF/Video downloading in the future as well.

Any feedback is appreciated! :)

The workflow is very similar to how it is building a website, except that you use python instead of JavaScript, and that you build an app. And it's all native. The window is actually a browser, similar to how Electron does it. The best part is that you have full access to the DOM as you would in JavaScript, with basically no latency. The only problem right now is that it takes 2 - 4 seconds to fully load an app, but this is resolved by implementing a loading window. Similar to how Discord does it, which is also built on Electron btw.

VS Code can individually execute code cells defined with `# %%` from a .py file and show results in IPython which is exactly what I want.. but the problem is that results are shown in a separate window not right below the cell, and rerunning the cell shows a new figure in IPython instead of replacing it.

I was given the job partly because of my (limited) coding experience, I kind of thought it would be a good place to use code ‘for the boring stuff’ and improve, and maybe use python on some of the project work. I wasn’t hired as a developer or anything but there have been times where python would have been great to use. I’ve needed to source and rename thousands of images for example for an online catalog, I could have done that in minutes with python but instead had to use excel and a convoluted VBA script… 

I’m now at the point where we’d like to design a system wherein our designers can input product data onto a program that generates the excel code or a product data file, but will automatically check for mistakes and standardise phrasing to avoid errors that have until now, been pretty common. Python seems like a nice candidate for this but I’m kind of stuck with Excel at the moment… 

Are there security concerns with python in businesses?

EDIT: thanks for all the responses guys, I’m not exactly looking for a solution to this however.

* This course is for beginners and assumes no previous programming experience, but the second half is useful for experienced programmers who want to learn about various third-party Python modules.
* If you don't have time to take the course now, that's fine. Signing up gives you lifetime access so you can work on it at your own pace.
* This Udemy course covers roughly the same content as the 1st edition book (the book has a little bit more, but all the basics are covered in the online course), which you can read for free online at https://inventwithpython.com
* The 2nd edition of Automate the Boring Stuff with Python is free online: https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/
* I do plan on updating the Udemy course for the second edition, but it'll take a while because I have other book projects I'm working on. Expect that update to happen in mid-2021. If you sign up for this Udemy course, you'll get the updated content automatically once I finish it. It won't be a separate course.
* It's totally fine to start on the first edition and then read the second edition later. I'll be writing a blog post to guide first edition readers to the parts of the second edition they should read.
* I wrote a blog post to cover [what's new in the second edition](https://inventwithpython.com/blog/2019/10/07/whats-new-in-the-2nd-edition-of-automate-the-boring-stuff-with-python/)
* **You're not too old to learn to code. You don't need to be ""good at math"" to be good at coding.**
* Signing up is the first step.

Hi everyone, been a long time lurker here inspired by the resourcefulness and commitment of people on this subreddit to finding clever ways to pinch every penny.

tldr: I code a ton and I made one of my programs accessible on the web so people can see Whole Foods sale items near them with less hassle! [Access the tool here](https://wholey-frugal.herokuapp.com): [https://wholey-frugal.herokuapp.com](https://wholey-frugal.herokuapp.com/) and if interested I am happy to share any and all code!

I have worked on many web scraping/coding projects for fun in the past so last year I wrote a bit of code to find all sale items at all the Whole Foods near me and then yield a list with the items (alongside with the store name with the sale closest to me). I then decided that I wanted to share what I made with you all in case it even helps one person - this is a personal project, no ads, nothing of the sort.

Just type in your ZIP Code (eg. 38103), City + State Abbreviation (eg. Memphis TN), or address and it will do all the work - I plan to work out a couple more hiccups in the code later today but for the most part it works for decently sized cities

They’re hard to version, hard to distribute, hard to re-use, hard to test, hard to review. I dont see a single benefit that you don’t get with plain python files with 0 effort.


ThEyRe InTErAcTiVe…

So is running scripts in your console. If you really want to go line-by-line use a repl or debugger.

Someone, please, please tell me what I’m missing, because I feel like we’re making a huge mistake as an industry by pushing this technology.

edit: Typo

Edit: So it seems the arguments for notebooks fall  in a few categories. The first category is “notebooks are a personal tool, essentially a REPL with a diffferent interface”. If this was true I wouldn’t care if my colleagues used them, just as I don’t care what editor they use. The problem is it’s not true. If I ask someone to share their code with me, nobody in their right mind would send me their ipython history. But people share notebooks with me all the time. So clearly notebooks are not just used as a REPL.

The second argument is that notebooks are good for exploratory work. Fair enough, I much prefer ipython for this, but to each their own. The problem is that the way people use notebooks in practice is to write end to end modeling code that needs to be tested and rerun on new data continuously. This is production code, not exploratory or prototype code. Most major cloud providers encourage this workflow by providing development and pipeline services centered around notebooks (I’m looking at you AWS, GCP and Databricks).

Finally, many people think that notebooks are great for communicating or reporting ideas. Fair enough I can appreciate that use case. Bus as we’ve already established, they are used for so much more.",spxim1,Reddit - r/Python

636,"Hey everyone, I'm a C/C++ programmer who recently discovered Python.  My friend told me about PyGame, and I decided to try to write an entire game in it.  I want to tell you the order I did things in, as I think you might find it interesting, and maybe try it yourself some time!

**Background:**

Epikos is an RPG I'd been wanting to make for years, but never really had the time to make.  Python, however, writes really expressive code and can really accelerate dev time.  I feel like I can write code 50X faster in Python than in C++.

Since I have a day job, this had to be a project which I could do after work.  Entire thing took about two years, including making all the assets for the game and all the tools.  Workload was about 2 hours after work each day, and a lot more time on the weekends.

**Step 1:  Making the tools for the game**

For reference, game screenshots can be seen here:

http://www.epikosrpg.com/screenshots/

**The Console:**

First, I made what I call a ""console.""  It's a bit like a DOS or Linux shell.  I wanted this so I could type commands into my game and the toolset used to create the game.  It doesn't look like much, but here is an example of what the console looks like:

http://imgur.com/mMutYwL

**The Paint Program:**

Next, the game needed a program to create sprite art in.  I could have used photoshop, aesprite, or any number of paint programs, but I wanted to make my own custom sprite animation tool, and I wanted it in Python.  I had barely done any python coding at this point, but even then the paint tool took only a couple of days to write.  It's called tilemake, and it looks like this:

http://imgur.com/Qw4BMMc

As you can see, this paint tool uses the console, which I had built first.  In the above example, I have loaded the ""knight"" sprite, which is used for one of the main characters in the game.  The tool shows you multiple zoomed in versions of the sprite (""mips"") and you can paint on any one of them, using the CGA color palette.  You can also animate the sprites in this very tool.

I got a lot of milage out of this tool, as the game has 826 sprite frames in it, all made with this very paint program.

**The Map Editor:**

Now, my game needed 2D maps.  Since I had some art made with the paint program, it was time to arrange this art in the form of a map.  The map editor looks like this:

http://imgur.com/qLA9vYk

There are several components to this editor, but keep in mind I'm sticking 100% to Python.  In the main view, you can zoom and scroll about with the mouse, and paint using several different sized brushes.

You can see a column to the right which says ""natural"".  This shows all the sprites which are used in a natural environment.  There are other categories, such as indoors, dungeon, etc.  Categories were important, since I have many, many different sprites.

Finally, on the bottom you can see our old friend, the console.

**Step 2:  The Game Itself:**

Once you have the map editor, making a game isn't really that different, it just has gameplay logic.  Most of it is really simple, this includes combat logic, movement, etc.  I'm not going to go into the details of these since writing them in Python should be fairly trivial, but ask me if you want something explained in greater detail.  I will, however, go over some highlights and gotchas:

**AStar (A*):**

A* is a common AI algorithm used for pathing.  Implementing it in Python is pretty easy.  Python reads a lot like pseudocode, and A* can be found on wikipedia:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm

That code isn't really very different from Python is it?  As an excercise, you can try pasting that into Python and see what you need to change.  Hint:  not much.  Shouldn't take you more than half an hour to get some good AI pathing going.

**Save/Load with Pickle:**

I *love* pickle, and used it for save/loading.  It's a standard Python module, so if you haven't used it yet you should check it out.  One gotcha was that saveing and loading maps was too expensive in pickle, so I compressed the maps first with basic dictionary encoding, and then used pickle on them.

When writing save/load, make sure to include version filtering or some mechanism so that if you change file formats later on, older files are automatically updated.  You don't want your players to lose progress just because you patched and changed savegame format!

**Font?:**

There are several legal issues surrounding the use of fonts on a cross-platform title, and I really didn't want to bother with that.  I couldn't find a good free font which matched my art style, so I created my own font for my game.  If you can do this, I recommend it, because then you own it and can use it forever.

**Music:**

One thing I didn't write from scratch was the music authoring software.  Audio isn't really my expertise, but I wanted NES sounding music.  I ended up using this:

http://famitracker.com/

Famitracker is a fun way to write NES-sounding music, and indeed it actually writes to the nes file format.  Of course, PyGame can't play this, so I converted it to .ogg format.  Why .ogg?  I found that other supported formats tended to crash pygame, so I recommend that one.

**Sound FX:**

Similarly, I wanted an old-school feeling for my sound FX.  Authoring these in famitracker didn't seem that efficient, but someone showed me a tool called bfxr:

http://www.bfxr.net/

This let me create all kinds of sounds for my game.  For more complicated sounds, I needed to fallback to famitracker, but 90% of the sounds were in bfxr.

**Shipping the Game:**

I couldn't ship raw .py files, so I used pyinstaller to turn my game into a single .exe file.  I had tried python2exe, but couldn't get it to work very well with pygame.  Maybe you can have better luck with python2exe, but I'd recommend pyinstaller.  PyInstaller uses another library called setupTools.  For some reason, my .exe wouldn't work with the latest version of setupTools (gave an error and immediately quit), so I had to do this:

pip install setuptools==19.2

That gives you the older version, which should work.

The last part of shipping is making the .exe and game assets into an installer.  For this I used something called NSIS.  Sadly, I can't recommend you use this at this point, since it was on Sourceforge and if you go there now you'll probably get viruses and malware (RIP Sourceforge).  If you happen to have an older version of NSIS, I recommend backing it up on your google drive, since re-downloading it is not an option.

**Conclusion:**

While there were some gotchas, I didn't have too much trouble making a small-scale game 100% in Python, and it was a suitable project to do after work, even while working a full-time job.  

Happy coding!

**Edit:**

Thank you for the Reddit gold.  This has inspired me to share some other misc info with you now:

*  One huge advantage of Python is that porting from Windows to Linux only took an afternoon.  I did it all on virtualbox running Mint.  In fact, setting up virtualbox to run Mint was harder than porting the game.  There were two gotchas.  First, if you're using time.clock() on windows, make sure to change it to time.time() on Linux.  Second, some of the backslashes in filenames needed to be changed to forward slashes.  That's it!!!

*  If you are on Windows, I recommend trying the Python plug-in for Visual Studio.  I didn't actually use it while developing my game, but I think it would have helped from time to time.  It gives breakpoints, variable watch, and callstack info.

640,"I'm a self taught programmer for about 2 years now. I started off by learning python then went on to learn javascript, java, kotlin, and now go. Whenever I tried to learn these languages or new languages I always was thinking 'I could do this much easier in python.\` Python is just so nice to work with that it makes me not want to use anything else. And with no need to use anything else that means there is no drive to learn anything else. 

Most recently while I was trying to learn go I attempted to make a caeser cipher encoder/decoder. I went about this by using a slice containing the alphabet and then collecting a step. My plan was then to find the index of a letter in the code string in the slice then shift that index accordingly. In python I would simply just use `.index`. But after some research and asking questions I found that go doesn't support generics (currently) and in order to replicate this functionality I would have to use a binary sort on a sorted slice.

Python also does small quality of life things that just come with it being dynamically typed. Like when initializing variables in for loops there is no `i = 0;` etc. On top of all that there is also pip. It is so nice to just `pip install [x]` instead of having to download file then pointing to an executable. Python and pip also allows for pythons to be used for so much. Want to do some web dev? Try django or flask. Interested in AI? How about pytorch.

I guess I'm just trying to say that python is so nice to use as a developer that it makes me not want to use anything else. I'm also really looking for advice on how to over come this, besides just double down and do it.

Yet, I found it tedious always to specify those arguments if I just want to perform a quick analysis. That is why I have created an Excel Add-In, which does all the tiresome work. As shown in the gif below, after I select the data I want to transform into a pandas dataframe, the add-in will create a python file in the workbook's directory.

* skiprows *\[Number of lines to skip (int) at the start of the file\]*
* usecols *\[Excel column letters and column ranges (e.g. “A:E”)\]*
* nrows *\[Number of rows to parse\]*

659,"Recently as a 14-year old in high school I've created a machine learning library, [SeaLion](https://pypi.org/project/sealion/), from scratch. It  took around 3 months of programming, and is 5k+ lines and uses Python and Cython. The library is also very well maintained (just had my first issue yesterday - thanks u/ForceBru!)

You can install this library with pip. It's on PyPI : [https://pypi.org/project/sealion/](https://pypi.org/project/sealion/) and GitHub : [SeaLion Repo](https://github.com/anish-lakkapragada/SeaLion)

A problem I saw with the current ml libraries and tutorials was that they didn't go over too much into the theory of these libraries - more so on just the syntax and calling the functions. In the summer of 2020 I could easily build a CNN or RNN in tensorflow, but I didn't understand it - hence I decided to start learning from scratch. It has been quite a ride and I needed a lot of help along the way to help me understand the math (I've never taken a calculus class) but it has been tremendously useful in helping me understand every aspect of ML from the code, theory, and the speed.

**SeaLion is an extremely comprehensive library that spans from basic Linear Regression up to modern approaches like deep neural networks. It mostly deals with regression, unsupervised clustering, bayesian models, dimensionality reduction, neural networks, etc. If you've never heard some of those algorithms before (or just are a complete beginner to ML), you are in the right place!! SeaLion has plenty of code examples to help guide you through each step of the way!**

The examples go over not just how sealion's code can be called but the intuition on how they work. They compare and contrast the benefits and cons of KMeans vs. DBSCAN or PCA vs. tSNE and go over each function in a easy-to-understand way. SeaLion is extremely easy to use, and the API function names and classes are similar to those of other ml libraries to make it easier for those experienced to grasp the syntax. Of course none of the actual source code uses any ml frameworks.

You can find the code examples here : [SeaLion Repo](https://github.com/anish-lakkapragada/SeaLion)

If you would like to install, please make sure you are on version 4.0.1 and have Python 3.

I think you'll greatly enjoy SeaLion, especially if you are just getting started. Please give the repo a star! And to all my other coders, regardless of your age : keep pushing!!

663,"*TL;DR I used our Scalene profiler (pip install scalene) and some math to make an example program run 5000x faster.*

I am quite interested in Python performance so naturally I read this article — [https://martinheinz.dev/blog/64](https://martinheinz.dev/blog/64), whose title is *Profiling and Analyzing Performance of Python Programs.* It presents an example program from the Python documentation ([https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html)) and shows how to run it with several time-worn Python profilers. Unfortunately, it doesn’t come away with much actionable information, beyond, more or less, “try [*PyPy*](https://www.pypy.org/)””, which speeds up the code by about 2x. I wondered if I would be able to get more useful information from Scalene, a profiler I co-wrote.

[Scalene: https:\/\/github.com\/plasma-umass\/scalene\/, pip install scalene](https://preview.redd.it/cg4u621qp4b81.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9aaf92125523801c12bbef4fc1f649cc499da3e)

We developed Scalene to be a lot more useful than existing Python profilers: it provides line-level information, splits out Python from native time, profiles memory usage, GPU, and even copying costs, all at a line granularity.

Anyway, here’s the result of running Scalene (just with CPU profiling) on the example code. It really cuts to the chase.

    % scalene --cpu-only --reduced-profile test/test-martinheinz.py

https://preview.redd.it/j1yhxptvp4b81.png?width=1400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3bc8d25415fc8ac25a8f7da3031299a724fa02cf

You can see that practically all the execution time is spent computing the ratio between num and fact, so really this is the only place to focus any optimization efforts. The fact that there is a lot of time spent running native code means that this line is executing some C library under the covers.

It turns out that it is dividing two `Decimal`s (a.k.a. [bignums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary-precision_arithmetic)). The underlying bignum library is written in C code and is pretty fast, but the factorial in particular is getting really large really fast. In one of the example inputs, the final value of `fact` is 11,000 digits long! No surprise: doing math on such huge numbers is expensive. Let’s see what we can do to make those numbers smaller.

I observe that we can compute `num / fact` not from scratch but incrementally: update a variable on each loop iteration via a computation on drastically smaller numbers. To do this, I add a new variable `nf` which will always equal the ratio `num / fact`. Then, on each loop iteration, the program updates `nf` by multiplying it by `x / i.` You can verify this maintains the invariant `nf == num/fact` by observing the following (where `_new` means the computation of the updated variable in each iteration).

    nf == num / fact                  # true by induction
    nf_new == nf * (x / i)            # we multiply by x/i each time
    nf_new == (num / fact) * (x / i)  # definition of nf
    nf_new == (num * x) / (fact * i)  # re-arranging
    nf_new == num_new / fact_new      # simplifying

Incorporating this into the original program required changing three lines of code, all of which are followed by ###:

    def exp_opt(x):
      getcontext().prec += 2
      i, lasts, s, fact, num = 0, 0, 1, 1, 1
      nf = Decimal(1)   ### was: = num / fact
      while s != lasts:
          lasts = s
          i += 1
          fact *= i
          num *= x
          nf *= (x / i) ### update nf to be num / fact
          s += nf       ### was: s += num / fact
      getcontext().prec -= 2
      return +s

The result of this change is, uh, *dramatic*.

**Frequently Asked Questions:** (*read this before posting questions*)

* This course is for beginners and assumes no previous programming experience, but the second half is useful for experienced programmers who want to learn about various third-party Python modules.
* If you don't have time to take the course now, that's fine. Signing up gives you lifetime access so you can work on it at your own pace.
* This Udemy course covers roughly the same content as the 1st edition book (the book has a little bit more, but all the basics are covered in the online course), which you can read for free online at https://inventwithpython.com
* The 2nd edition of Automate the Boring Stuff with Python is now available online: https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/
* I do plan on updating the Udemy course for the second edition, but it'll take a while because I have other book projects I'm working on. Expect that update to happen in mid- or late-2020. If you sign up for this Udemy course, you'll get the updated content automatically once I finish it. It won't be a separate course.
* It's totally fine to start on the first edition and then read the second edition later. I'll be writing a blog post to guide first edition readers to the parts of the second edition they should read.
* I wrote a blog post to cover [what's new in the second edition](https://inventwithpython.com/blog/2019/10/07/whats-new-in-the-2nd-edition-of-automate-the-boring-stuff-with-python/)

669,"Hi there, my name is Harrison and I frequently do Python programming tutorials on [PythonProgramming.net](https://pythonprogramming.net) and [YouTube.com/sentdex](https://www.youtube.com/user/sentdex).  All tutorials are free in both text and video forms.

The latest series that I have put out is [Python for Finance](https://pythonprogramming.net/getting-stock-prices-python-programming-for-finance/). The aim of this series is to show what can be done with Python in the field of finance and algorithmic trading using data science (spoiler alert: a lot!). 

Even though you probably aren’t going to get rich, you might save yourself a lot of money (when you back test your silly trading idea and realize it’s bad), and you’ll learn about statistics and data science with Python along the way. 

I start the series off with a simplistic introduction to using Python+[Pandas](https://pythonprogramming.net/data-analysis-python-pandas-tutorial-introduction/)+[Matplotlib](https://pythonprogramming.net/matplotlib-intro-tutorial/)  to get stock data, visualize stock data, and to manipulate this data. 

From here, we get into Quantopian, which is a Python-based platform built on top of the Zipline library for back-testing, but has since expanded out to enable quite a bit more than that.

We use Quantopian both for simplistic back testing, but also for doing research into future trading strategies, since Quantopian also provides a bunch of free data like minute pricing data, fundamentals along with tools like [Alphalens](https://github.com/quantopian/alphalens) for analyzing various factors that you believe to be beneficial to a trading strategy.

If you would like to check it out, the series starts here:

681,"Nowadays Python is one of the most popular programming languages. Specialists value its universality for all types of the tasks. Today, one of the most important qualities is convenience of command execution, but often developers have to write a relatively simple program, the quality criterion of which is an intuitive graphical interface. You have several ways to do this by means of Python. The following development tools are among the most popular:

* [PyQt](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/). The widespread Qt library, which implementations are available in various languages. It’s written in C++ and is cross-platform. This library allows the development of applications that have familiar and ordinary appearance in the general sense of this word.
* [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html)**.** This tool is often referred to as standard for developing GUI applications in Python, appeared back in the early 90s of the twentieth century. Due to the long history and ease of use, Tkinter has a rather extensive and active community. It’s thanks to it you can find a large number of semi-finished products or publications in the network and get an answer to any question at specialized forums.
* [WxPython](https://wxpython.org)**.** Another descendant of C++, namely WxPython, links the wxWidgets cross-platform library with Python. In some ways, Tkinter and WxPython are quite similar, but WxPython is slightly younger and is more advanced approach to creating GUI applications in Python. Also, the entry barriers for the start are quite low due to the rapidly developing and friendly community. Perhaps the installation and the first steps will require a little more effort than the tools described above, but believe me, the result is worth it!

At a certain stage I chose PyQt for my work and in this article would like to show you an example of creating the simplest application for a content manager; so you’ll get to know the GUI for Python, libraries for natural language processing, and several ways of creating \*.exe file from \*.py for Python 3.6 script.

# Step 1. Python GUI: Creating simple application with PyQt and Qt Designer

First you need to understand what software is wanted. The content manager of [Casino Now](https://casino-now.co.uk) project gives priority to such parameters of content as

* Word count
* Number of characters
* Percentage of stop words
* Keyword density
* Presence of keywords in headers
* List of popular n-grams
* Text’s uniqueness

If for some reason you haven’t yet installed the PyQt library, the simplest method is to enter this code in the command line

    pip3 install PyQt5

All support tools will be installed automatically. When the installation is completed, open Qt Designer and create the necessary form using standard elements.

&amp;#x200B;

[Figure 1 – General view of the dialog box](https://preview.redd.it/ch0j426wgxe21.jpg?width=1138&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd0047e99d031a95d1632d9e7476c7836dd69e04)

The following is the layout of future application. Don’t judge too harshly, this is just an introductory demo to show several possibilities ;)

&amp;#x200B;

[Figure 2 – Dialog box](https://preview.redd.it/i1e9saywgxe21.png?width=594&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9236d074fa9b40151e6343d5dce1174468984e86)

Bear in mind the specialized tools to keep the graphical interface user-friendly regardless of workspace’ scaling.

&amp;#x200B;

[Figure 3 – Example of saving workspace proportions when scaling](https://preview.redd.it/jeez8qxxgxe21.jpg?width=1136&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1d0b6f128132a2185c83ad78e89d988b448f3f6)

In order to turn the interface into a program code for use, you have to save the resulting layout. Thus, the file with MainForm.ui extension is received. To get access in the framework from the project, you need to convert the MainForm.ui file to the \*.py extension. To do this, go through the command line to the folder containing the file with \*.ui and run the following command

    pyuic5 -x MainForm.ui -o MainForm.py

&amp;#x200B;

[Figure 4 – File conversion](https://preview.redd.it/az5emddzgxe21.jpg?width=411&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=256f04d8bd8b32b7f697e9f9cf61260eeec995bf)

Thus, you get the file of required extension and can run a prototype of the application.

&amp;#x200B;

The full source code has the structure presented at Figure 6. You can find the expanded version on my Github [https://github.com/TinaWard](https://github.com/TinaWard). In this article, I’d like to explain the application’s build in more detail.

&amp;#x200B;

[Figure 6 – Application code](https://preview.redd.it/qqkq0331hxe21.jpg?width=889&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ee7b345c93410ffe5fb7fec4a6145874427e788b)

# Step 2. How to convert python script in exe

The most popular tools for building an application today are [PyInstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org) or [cx\_Freeze](https://anthony-tuininga.github.io/cx_Freeze/). For this article let’s focus on such building method as cx\_Freeze. As a matter of fact, it’s analogous to PyInstaller with the only difference that in case of PyInstaller you don’t need to write your own installer script (setup.py), but at the same time, the similar manipulations must be performed via the command line or in the \* .spec file. The tool cx\_Freeze is set in the standard way:

    pip install cx_freeze
    pip install –user cx_freeze

The first step in creating a full-fledged application is the proper formation of the setup.by file.

The following is the frame of this file. The steps of the **setup.by** file are intuitive, but let’s look in more detail. First of all, import two entities: the setup function and Executable class. The most informative is the **options** dictionary (dictionary of dictionaries as it's usually called), which is used to improve the build. It may have such parameters:

* **excludes** – list with description of modules not to be included in the assembly. You shouldn’t overuse this parameter, since you can overdo and delete what you really need: nested dependencies.
* **includes** – parameter opposite to excludes, that’s the list of signal modules that must be included in the assembly. Also cx\_freeze may not find some packages or modules, in particular if they were imported into similar package using the import function. If you have a GUI application, you have to specify the name of the script with the \*.py extension, in our case it’s **MainForm**.py.
* **packages** – compulsory packages to be included.
* **zip\_include\_packages** – list of packages to be archived
* **include\_files** – list of lines or files tuples that need to be added to the assembly, but these are not Python files.

Now let's take a closer look at the Executable class:

* **targetName** allows you to specify the name of the \*.exe file, by default it matches the name of the launching script.
* **base** = **‘Win32GUI’** If you set a parameter as described in the example, it means that the graphical application is processing and the console window will not appear.
* **icon** – parameter to set the icon of the application launcher, by default uses pictures with \*.ico ext.

&amp;#x200B;

    # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
    
    from cx_Freeze import setup, Executable
    import os
    options = {
    'build.exe': { 'icludes': ['MainForm'], 'packages': ['pandas'], 'excludes ': excludes } }
    os.environ['TCL_LIBRARY'] = r'C:\Users\User3\Anaconda3\tcl\tcl8.6'
    os.environ['TK_LIBRARY'] = r'C:\Users\User3\Anaconda3\tcl\tk8.6'
    setup(
    name = ""TextTool"", version = ""0.0"", description = ""Here write smth"", options = options, executables = [Executable('TextToolS.py', targetName = ‘ThisIsName.exe’)])

To compile you need to run the setup.py file. To do this, enter the following code via the command line from the project directory:

    python setup.py build

After that you will see the launch of the project build.

&amp;#x200B;

[Figure 7 – Running project build](https://preview.redd.it/jgtrlj6khxe21.jpg?width=655&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=480540ce993a8208c81fce78d18c3413149f8f9b)

Building a project can take from 10 seconds to several minutes, depending on the size and number of interconnected modules in your application.

Not always the project build runs smoothly, let’s look at some of the most common mistakes. Most of them can be solved by searching and writing in the correct parameters of the setup function in the setup.py file, but often due to laziness or lack of time, the temporary ways are implemented to solve this problem. For example, this one, when you haven’t specified the module’s addition:

&amp;#x200B;

[Figure 8 – Error example](https://preview.redd.it/dx9fl0glhxe21.jpg?width=873&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3955eff4159f0fdff1a670fe7d664e05f11a5cce)

    ""Missing required dependencies {0}"".format(missing_dependencies))
    ImportError: Missing required dependencies ['numpy']

To make this just copy \_methods.py file from Anaconda library

…\\Anaconda3\\Lib\\site-packages\\numpy\\core

to numpy folder ‘core’, located

…\\build\\exe.win-amd64-3.6\\lib\\numpy\\core.

&amp;#x200B;

The second common mistake is undersampling hidden dependencies. It’s possible that you didn’t see the hidden dependencies of the packages and didn’t add it. Often the problem occurs with packages like idnadata

&amp;#x200B;

[Figure 10 – Second type error](https://preview.redd.it/46jgu19ohxe21.jpg?width=800&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e60341d7b67b77cad604b95cbcfb313ddc1edd69)

    File ""C:\Users\User3\Anaconda3\lib\site-packages\tldextract\__init__.py"", line 3, in &lt;module&gt;
    from .cli import __version__
    File ""C:\Users\User3\Anaconda3\lib\site-packages\tldextract\cli.py"", line 14, in &lt;module&gt;
    from .tldextract import TLDExtract
    File ""C:\Users\User3\Anaconda3\lib\site-packages\tldextract\tldextract.py"", line 62, in &lt;module&gt;
    import idna
    File ""C:\Users\User3\Anaconda3\lib\site-packages\idna\__init__.py"", line 2, in &lt;module&gt;
    from .core import *
    File ""C:\Users\User3\Anaconda3\lib\site-packages\idna\core.py"", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
    from . import idnadata
    ImportError: cannot import name 'idnadata'

The algorithm is the same, you find the missing file in the folders of the installed libraries and copy it in the appropriate folder of your assembly. This’s win-win option if you need a quick compilation for testing.

From …\\Anaconda3\\Lib\\site-packages\\idna to …\\build\\exe.win-amd64-3.6\\lib\\idna

&amp;#x200B;

In general, the advantages of cx\_Freeze are:

* Startup files for Linux
* MSI installers for Windows
* RPM packages for Linux
* Software packages for Mac OS X (.app, .dmg)

The disadvantages are:

* No possibility to pack all python-modules and dll-files in one exe-file
* No cross compilation

686,"I feel like there are a lot of packages out there that are incredibly useful, but often get overlooked for one reason or another. It seems like people spend a lot of time re-implementing something that's already been done pretty well, and that's too bad. Because, using a nice package with a slick api is like taking a breath of crisp morning mountain air.

So here's some packages I love that I think folks should know about and take a look for themselves:

[Inflection](http://inflection.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): Inflection is ridiculously useful. It has all kinds of tools for altering strings into different formats. Think, conversion from CamelCase to snake\_case. Or, even ordinalizing numbers (1 -&gt; 'first'). Pluralization is in there too. It's really handy with lots of features. I've used it for a few years now without any problems and a whole lot of fresh air in my life.

[Pendulum](https://pendulum.eustace.io/): Python's datetime library is....well, painful to use. It has most everything you need, but doing what you want might be a whole afternoon of consternation. I used a few date/time libraries before I stumbled onto Pendulum. This library is really great. Not only does it offer a great parser that you rarely have to provide anything more than a string representation of a datetime, but it has lots of really useful utilities for working with dates and times (and both). Finally, the best part is that it's a \_drop-in\_ replacement! In fact, Pendulum DateTime objects inherit from python's native DateTime, so you can almost always use them anywhere you would use normal DateTime. This one has been a favorite for a long time.

[pprintpp](https://github.com/wolever/pprintpp): Python's native pretty-printer often renders stuff that's...well, not pretty at all. I often deal with a lot of deeply nested native data-structures (basically JSON rendered into python), and when I'm debugging python's pretty-printer feels pretty stuffy. Enter pprintpp. It's a drop-in replacement that can monkey-patch the built-in pprint function. At any rate, my deeply-nested dicts are formatted with a whole lot more readability in my logs with this package

[Snakeviz](https://jiffyclub.github.io/snakeviz/): Profiling performance becomes a pretty necessary task in most python projects with any degree of longevity. However, exploring profile dumps can be a super stuffy experience a lot of times. I've suffered through enough non-intuitive files and interfaces trying to dig down to the cause of slowness in my lifetime. Then, I found Snakeviz. It provides a really intuitive, interactive, in-browser way to explore profiling information. This tool has actually made profiling fun and exciting, and I can't recommend it enough.

[Livereload](https://github.com/lepture/python-livereload): Suppose you're doing something like, say, working on your project's documentation. It's really not fun to, after each tweak of your config or doc files, have to manually run the sphinx-build commands and then open the produced html in a browser. Instead, you might try Livereload. You provide a list of files to watch, run it, and open a browser. Then, any time you change the file, your page will automatically reload. It's a core element of one of my personal projects (sphinx-view...and this doesn't count as my plug), and without it things would be a lot more painful. It can also be used for any number of other situations where html is produced from source files. It's pretty easy to use, too, and soo crisp and cool when you see it in action.

Finally...my plug:

[py-buzz](https://github.com/dusktreader/py-buzz): ""That's not flying, it's falling with style."" Honestly...I have way too much fun with the name. The whole point of this package is that I found myself re-writing the same pattern over and over with custom exceptions. Typically, when I'm writing a new library, I end up with a custom exception base-class that I use (along with derived exceptions) throughout the project. Then, I end up doing the same thing over and over. Well, I took that irritation and turned it into a tool. The handiest parts of this package is the \`Buzz.require\_condition\` function that acts like an assert that isn't disabled in production and \`Buzz.handle\_errors\` which gives you a context manager to handle exceptions within a block. I dog-food the hell out of this package, so it should be in great working order. There's other neat features, but I'll let you read up yourself, if you're interested.

If not, please enjoy learning about the other 5 packages above.

690,"**TLDR**: The [tool is hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/juftin/yellowstone-camping), scrapes the [Yellowstone Campsite Availability](https://secure.yellowstonenationalparklodges.com/booking/lodging) API, and sends push notifications to your mobile device when a campsite becomes available.


**UPDATE**: This project was expanded to search Yellowstone and all of [recreation.gov](https://recreation.gov) (thousands of campgrounds all over the USA). More info at [github.com/juftin/camply](https://github.com/juftin/camply).

My partner and I are taking a trip this summer (July, 2021) from home in Colorado through Wyoming to Glacier National Park. Like all national parks right now, the campsites in Glacier are a hot commodity and tough to come by.

To help us get an advantage in finding a site we signed up for [*Campnab*](https://campnab.com/), a service that lets you sign up for text notifications when booked out campgrounds receive cancellations. Long story short, it's totally worth it I have nothing but great things to say about it. We found a 5 day cancellation and booked our first choice campground within a couple weeks of signing up for text alerts.

On our way home from Glacier we'll be going through Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Park. Unfortunately, Campnab doesn't (currently) work for most sites in Yellowstone, since they use a different booking provider than the rest of the National Park System. Instead, I decided to play around with the booking website and build my own integration with their API. It runs in a docker container, and sends push notifications through [Pushover](https://pushover.net/).

Feature Requests and Technical Feedback / Questions are best done though the [Issues Page](https://github.com/juftin/yellowstone-camping/issues). Some basic command line skills and an always-on computer are required to run this.

We're still waiting for our Yellowstone spot as of writing this and can't wait to get back there this summer. I hope this tool is useful for someone out there, good luck hunting for your next spot!

# SkipYTAds

Hate YouTube ads **but don't want to use an ad blocker**? **You don't mind those ads because some are good or introduces you to new things but you don't want those extra long annoying ones?** Well, here's a python script just for that!

This python script automatically searches for the skip button every 6 seconds (adjustable) and if there is a skippable ad, it'll skip it for you. And if you're in the middle of watching a skippable ad but interested in continuing, just press the pause button (before it does  it's thing) and it'll pause the script. Then returns your cursor back to where it was (but does not refocus your original window; a desired  feature possibly added).

### Dev note:

**This script may be clunky and not robust but it works to my specs. I wanted something that clicks the button for me when I'm doing stuff and have a video playing.**

It doesn't work while in a game that centers your cursor and not allowing it outside of the window which I'm okay with.

**I don't use ad blockers because I actually like to see some of the ads.** But other ads like an ad of a tutorial on a brand of smart lights that is several minutes long is extremely displeasing.

I also did an online beginner course in JavaScript. The JS part was the most time-consuming part for me and mostly done by trial and error.

On top of that, doing this in Python is often portrayed as requiring third-party libraries in many books and tutorials out there.

This tool makes exclusive use of built-in Python 3.x libraries and automatically reads all the information required to initiate the attack, requesting from the user nothing but the target's IP address (as long as it belongs to the same network segment as the attacker, as is the case of any ARP spoofing attack).

Use this tool to assess the security controls implemented on your own networks, test Intrusion Detection Systems you may have set up or simply expand your knowledge on cybersecurity and Python programming in general.

**Frequently Asked Questions:** (*read this before posting questions*)

* This course is for beginners and assumes no previous programming experience, but the second half is useful for experienced programmers who want to learn about various third-party Python modules.
* If you don't have time to take the course now, that's fine. Signing up gives you lifetime access so you can work on it at your own pace.
* This Udemy course covers roughly the same content as the 1st edition book (the book has a little bit more, but all the basics are covered in the online course), which you can read for free online at https://inventwithpython.com
* The 2nd edition of Automate the Boring Stuff with Python is free online: https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/
* I do plan on updating the Udemy course for the second edition, but it'll take a while because I have other book projects I'm working on. If you sign up for this Udemy course, you'll get the updated content automatically once I finish it. It won't be a separate course.
* It's totally fine to start on the first edition and then read the second edition later. I'll be writing a blog post to guide first edition readers to the parts of the second edition they should read.
* I wrote a blog post to cover [what's new in the second edition](https://inventwithpython.com/blog/2019/10/07/whats-new-in-the-2nd-edition-of-automate-the-boring-stuff-with-python/)
* **You're not too old to learn to code. You don't need to be ""good at math"" to be good at coding.**
* Signing up is the first step. Actually finishing the course is the next. :) [There are several ways to get/stay motivated.](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/wiki/faq#wiki_how_can_i_get.2Fstay_motivated_to_learn_programming.3F) I suggest getting a ""gym buddy"" to learn with.

760,"Good day y'all,

Im a 15 year old Python dev and I've just finished building my first major Python project with UI. I tinkered a lot with tKinter (pun almost unintended) and even tried PyQT5. Both of these are time consuming to work with and tKinter's GUI looks like it shouldve been abandoned in 2005. Thats when my quest of finding an easy and modern looking UI Library started. And then I found Python Eel. Eel isnt a GUI Library like tKinter, but it can help link up python as backend with HTML/ CSS as the front. I didn't really know HTML and CSS a lot, but it was fairly easy. My project is at [https://github.com/JeswinSunsi/PentyDesktopAssistant](https://github.com/JeswinSunsi/PentyDesktopAssistant) . It has a bit of Spaghetti code, but its pretty neat. I would appreciate it if you guys could check it out and give a review. Also, star it if you can ;)

Thankss.  


Edit: After a lot of people told me, I gave another look into PyQt. Although I would still have designed Penty with Eel, PyQt actually doesn't seem too hard, that is, after the sorta steep learning curve. But once you've mastered the basics, it'd be way more readable and easier.

Edit 2: I never expected this post to get these many upvotes and positive comments. Thanks to everyone, y'all made my day! Also, you can PM me here if you have any doubts or want to tell me anything related to Python, I'll try my best to reply to everyone. Cheers!",i7xb5f,Reddit - r/Python

762,"Bit o' background: While I've always loved computers and dabbled with web dev as a kid, I recently (6ish months?) started coding again hardcore. I had just had a business fail, money was tight as shit, debt to our eyeballs... and I wanted to start again with one of my oldest passions that I'd always been afraid to pursue. So I hunkered down and got into Python, because I remembered liking the language. 

I pretty quickly got a job in non-Python web dev (Angular and Node.Js, which I was competent enough in thanks to dabbling) but it was awful. Barely over minimum wage, and despite being very junior I was expected to manage an entire code base and servers and essentially everything techy. So I did the best I could, kept working on my Python projects in my free time, and kept applying to new positions.

Eventually a recruiter took a liking to me, and got me some interviews for Python positions. One I totally bombed, but the other two actually ended in two very enthusiastic offers. I ended up being offered more than I'd even asked for, way more than I expected as a Junior. I took the offer and put in my notice at my old job, which ended this past Friday.

I just can't express how excited I am to have this opportunity, the company culture seems amazing, I'll be able to get out of debt, I'll have room to grow and learn and thrive... on one hand I couldn't have done it without reddit communities guiding me (hi, cscareerquestions and learnpython) and on the other hand I'm just so damn proud.

Anyways, I start on the 17th. I'm half sharing because I'm just really excited, but also, if anyone has advice for starting in a junior role with a huge company, I'd love to hear it. I want to give this my best shot. Thanks, y'all.",n332zn,Reddit - r/Python

Python is great in that it's actually pretty simple to change its grammar once you know how to do so (editing the .gram file and regenerating a couple of files with `make regen-pegen`), after which you can recompile and voila, you have new grammar. In this case, I turned the `del` keyword into yeet, meaning you can write code like this:

Over the last year I've been working on a side project that leverages [Mycroft](https://mycroft.ai) (think: Alexa, but open-source and privacy-friendly) to do exciting things like stream video from Netflix, Amazon, and Youtube, or dig through your bookmarks for recipes etc.  It's finally in a state that I'm comfortable sharing with you all, [so here its](https://gitlab.com/danielquinn/majel).  I've named it *""Majel""* for [Majel Barrett-Roddenberry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majel_Barrett), a reference that'll make sense if you're a Trekkie.

## Some technical notes about the architecture if you're interested:

[Architecture diagram](https://preview.redd.it/ypm0jjv5ep961.png?width=1670&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79ac6127afe9b3b87f863c6fb12844b28d21a319)

Majel sits on top of Mycroft.ai's voice activation system as a set of three (at the moment anyway) ""skills"" that know what to do when certain voice commands are issued.  These skills do a little research around what a command might mean -- For example you could say: `""play the west wing""`, the `streamer-skill` will figure out where you're most likely to find [The West Wing](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0200276/) (including your local `.mkv` files) and then push the location of the stream into Mycroft's [message bus framework](https://mycroft-ai.gitbook.io/docs/mycroft-technologies/mycroft-core/message-bus) and exit.

The other part of the equation is the `majel` program that just listens for these messages and then executes different processes based on what comes down the pipe.  If it gets a Netflix or Amazon URL for example, it'll point your browser (using Selenium) to the stream in question and ""click"" the play button, if it's a local file, it'll play it with MPV (thanks to `python-mpv`), etc.

Anyway, I'm really happy with how it's turned out and wanted to share.  It's licensed under the [AGPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Affero_General_Public_License), so contributions are always welcome and I've designed it to be very pluggable so I'm hoping to extend it to do some more stuff later: search Google/DuckDuckGo for arbitrary stuff, dig up products on Amazon, and (if I can figure out a smart way to do it) video-call my parents.",krmqiu,Reddit - r/Python

about a year ago my boss asked if there's any way we could monitor some machines we have up on racks in our DR site, i raised my hand and said i could write a python script that pings them and generates reports... he said 'awesome' do it... trouble was i had only a fleeting idea of what python is and no clue how to actually implement this...

i got home and started researching, took a couple of days to even start scripting anything but about a week later i had something that works... running this script is now one of my daily tasks

i then started tinkering with it sneakily during downtime even though i was technically never given permission to do it and eventually came up with a way to scrape user data from the network 24/7, i made it a point that this would be my own doing so research was limited to how to implement specific tasks and not downloading a ready made script off of github...

i've been logging this data for a while so i figured i should do something with it and started working on a support facing tkinter front end to streamline the way we handle support calls and tickets...

i showed it to my boss and he had me do a demo for the whole team today doing our team meeting... told everyone 'i encourage you to try it so we can get the bugs out, i'm later going to *tell* you to use it'... he said i'd also get dev time to improve it... everyone liked it and i've been getting good feedback about it... the feeling is amazing and i thought i'd share it with this community and maybe get some of your stories

792,"Something I struggled with for a long time is beginners, and it might just be a personal bias, but particular Python beginners. Both online and offline I see so many questions weekly that roughly fall into two camps

* Are there any universities that teach undergraduate CS purely using Python?
* How do I become a data analyst using Python\`?
* What should I learn to get a job as a python developer?
* How do I make quick money using Python?

While the other camp is roughly along the following lines

* I want to build a Python application that calls me and ask if I have taken my medicines.
* How do I build a website only using Python?
* I am playing game X, how do I train an AI to play the game perfectly?
* How do I make Python buy and sell crypto currency based on tweets?

I am not saying these are bad questions (from beginners), but they *irked* me. I was struggling to explain to beginners what the issue with questions such as these are. Is there an easy to understand analogy which would help. Finally, last night it struck me.

&gt;Python is a hammer, and we are carpenters, building houses

Lets rephrase the initial questions with this background instead to show how absurd they become

* Are there any universities that teach carpentry only using a hammer?
* How do I become a roofer, framer, ship carpentry etc., only using a hammer?
* What should I learn to quickly get a job using a hammer?
* How do I make quick money using a hammer?

Now we see that the fundamental issue with the first sleeve of questions is that Python is a tool, we as programmers use, to solve problems. Limiting our toolbox to only using a single tool would make it impossible for us to work. **In addition we are offered jobs based on how well we are able to solve problems, not on the particular tools we know**. If I am adding someone to my team I am 99% sure they have never worked with our framework, and *I could not care less if they are Thor the god of hammers*. What I care about is if they can learn our framework, flow of work and seamlessly fit our team after half a year or so of on-board training.

Instead we should first look at what we are trying to do, and then pick the right tool for the job.

Similarly the issue with the second handful questions is unfamiliarity with programming and the amount of work required to make something. What I like with the carpentry analogy is also that it is easier to visualize the *scale*. A real life program (or a house) is a big project, something that requires multiple people, several weeks or months to make. 

Maybe the carpentry / hammer analogy will help next time someone asks:

You put on some upbeat, happy music, and then you start coding. But even when the code is completely broken, the same music continues...

We don't let this happen in movies, so why let it happen when we code? I've tried to solve this problem by coming up with a solution called ""Coding Mood"".

**It plays horror music when your code breaks** ***e.g. when unit tests fail or it just crashes.***

For a full demo of it in action, check out my video:  [https://youtu.be/1LKTrZamxZk](https://youtu.be/1LKTrZamxZk)

There are two main parts to my solution. The first is a React Native mobile app, which connects to a server using a websocket. When the state of my code changes, the server pushes it to the mobile app and the music coming from the app changes.

The server is written using Python asyncio and Starlette. To those of you who haven't checked out Starlette before, it's really great. If you're familiar with Node.js and Express you'll be right at home. 

Currently the server just parses the test results when they are POST-ed to it, and if it finds any failures, it broadcasts to all connected clients.

The Python code for the server can be found here:  [https://github.com/theartofsoftware/coding-mood-server](https://github.com/theartofsoftware/coding-mood-server)

811,"Hi, we recently updated an article on Python web frameworks at our company blog. I was wondering if there are any other frameworks you find useful that we missed and should add to the list. I’m copying the entire list here (each entry also has some sample code, but I’m excluding that). Please let me know if you think we should add any framework. 

(and, if you’d like to check out the full article, you can find it here: [A Beginner’s Introduction to Python Web Frameworks](https://stxnext.com/blog/2018/09/27/beginners-introduction-python-frameworks/?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_campaign=2019-08-jd))

## Django

**The most popular Python framework is Django, hands down.** Django’s trademark is that it offers all the tools you need to build a web application within a single package, from low- to high-end.

Django applications are based on a design pattern similar to MVC, the so-called MVT (Model-View-Template) pattern. Models are defined using the Django ORM, while SQL databases are mainly used as storage.

Django has a built-in admin panel, allowing for easy management of the database content. With minimal configuration, this panel is generated automatically based on the defined models.

Views can include both functions and classes, and the assignment of URLs to views is done in one location (the urls.py file), so that after reviewing that single file you can learn which URLs are supported. Templates are created using a fairly simple Django Templates system.

Django is praised for strong community support and detailed documentation describing the functionality of the framework. This documentation coupled with getting a comprehensive environment after the installation makes the entry threshold rather low. Once you go through [the official tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/intro/tutorial01/), you’ll be able to do most of the things required to build an application.

**Unfortunately, Django’s monolithism also has its drawbacks.** It is difficult, though not impossible, to replace one of the built-in elements with another implementation. For example, using some other ORM (like SQLAlchemy) requires abandoning or completely rebuilding such items as the admin panel, authorization, session handling, or generating forms.

Because Django is complete but inflexible, it is suitable for standard applications (i.e. the vast majority of software projects). However, if you need to implement some unconventional design, it leads to struggling with the framework, rather than pleasant programming.

## Flask

Flask is considered a microframework. It comes with basic functionality, while also allowing for easy expansion. Therefore, **Flask works more as the glue that allows you to join libraries with each other.**

For example, “pure Flask” does not provide support for any storage, yet there are many different implementations that you can install and use interchangeably for that purpose (such as Flask-SQLAlchemy, Flask-MongoAlchemy, and Flask-Redis). Similarly, the basic template system is Jinja2, but you can use a replacement (like Mako).

The motto of this framework is “one drop at a time,” and this is reflected in its comprehensive documentation. The knowledge of how to build an application is acquired in portions here; after reading a few paragraphs, you will be able to perform basic tasks.

You don’t have to know the more advanced stuff right away—you’ll learn it once you actually need it. Thanks to this, students of Flask can gather knowledge smoothly and avoid boredom, making Flask suitable for learning.

**A large number of Flask extensions, unfortunately, are not supported as well as the framework itself.** It happens quite often that the plug-ins are no longer being developed or their documentation is outdated. In cases like these, you need to spend some time googling a replacement that offers similar functionality and is still actively supported.

When building your application with packages from different authors, you might have to put quite a bit of sweat into integrating them with each other. You will rarely find ready-made instructions on how to do this in the plug-ins’ documentation, but in such situations the Flask community and websites such as Stack Overflow should be of help.

## Pyramid

Pyramid, the third noteworthy Python web framework, is rooted in two other products that are no longer developed: Pylons and repoze.bfg. **The legacy left by its predecessors caused Pyramid to evolve into a very mature and stable project.**

The philosophies of Pyramid and Django differ substantially, even though both were released in the same year (2005). Unlike Django, Pyramid is trivial to customize, allowing you to create features in ways that the authors of the framework themselves hadn’t foreseen. It does not force the programmer to use framework’s idioms; it’s meant to be a solid scaffolding for complex or highly non-standard projects.

Pyramid strives to be persistence-agnostic. While there is no bundled database access module, a common practice is to combine Pyramid with the powerful, mature SQLAlchemy ORM. Of course, that’s only the most popular way to go. Programmers are free to choose whatever practices suit them best, such as using the peewee ORM, writing raw SQL queries, or integrating with a NoSQL database, just to name a few.

All options are open, though this approach requires a bit of experience to smoothly add the desired persistence mechanisms to the project. The same goes for other components, such as templating.

Openness and freedom are what Pyramid is all about. Modules bundled with it relate to the web layer only and users are encouraged to freely pick third-party packages that will support other aspects of their projects.

**However, this model causes a noticeable overhead at the beginning of any new project,**because you have to spend some time choosing and integrating the tools your team is comfortable with. Still, once you put the effort into making additional decisions during the early stages of the work, you are rewarded with a setup that makes it easy and comfortable to start a new project and develop it further.

Pyramid is a self-proclaimed “start small, finish big, stay finished framework.” This makes it an appropriate tool for experienced developers who are not afraid of playing the long game and working extra hard in the beginning, without shipping a single feature within the first few days. Less experienced programmers may feel a bit intimidated.

## web2py

Created in 2007, web2py is a framework originally designed as a teaching tool for students, so the main concern for its authors was ease of development and deployment.

Web2py is strongly inspired by Django and Ruby on Rails, sharing the idea of **convention over configuration. In other words, web2py provides many** ***sensible defaults*** **that allow developers to get off the ground quickly.**

This approach also means there are a lot of goodies bundled with web2py. You will find everything you’d expect from a web framework in it, including a built-in server, HTML-generating helpers, forms, validators, and many more—nothing unusual thus far, one could argue. Support for multiple database engines is neat, though it’s a pretty common asset among current web frameworks.

However, some other bundled features may surprise you, since they are not present in other frameworks:

* helpers for creating [JavaScript](https://stxnext.com/services/javascript-development/)\-enabled sites with jQuery and Ajax;
* scheduler and cron;
* 2-factor authentication helpers;
* text message sender;
* an event-ticketing system, allowing for automatic assignment of problems that have occurred in the production environment to developers.

The framework proudly claims to be a full-stack solution, providing everything you could ever need.

Web2py has extensive documentation available online. It guides newcomers step by step, starting with a short introduction to the Python language. The introduction is seamlessly linked with the rest of the manual, demonstrating different aspects of web2py in a friendly manner, with lots of code snippets and screenshots.

**Despite all its competitive advantages, web2py’s community is significantly smaller than Django’s, or even Pyramid’s.** Fewer developers using it means your chances of getting help and support are lower. The official mailing list is mostly inactive.

Additionally—and unfortunately—web2py is not compatible with Python 3 at the moment. This state of things puts the framework’s prospects into question, as support for Python 2 ends in 2020. This issue is being addressed on the project’s github. [Here](https://github.com/web2py/web2py/issues/1353) is where you can track the progress.

## Sanic

**Sanic differs considerably from the aforementioned frameworks because unlike them, it is based on asyncio**—Python’s toolbox for asynchronous programming, bundled with the standard library starting from version 3.4.

In order to develop projects based on Sanic, you have to grasp the ideas behind asyncio first. This involves a lot of theoretical knowledge about coroutines, concurrent programming caveats, and careful reasoning about the data flow in the application.

Once you get your head around Sanic/asyncio and applies the framework to an appropriate problem, the effort pays off. Sanic is especially useful when it comes to handling long-living connections, such as websockets. If your project requires support for websockets or making a lot of long-lasting external API calls, Sanic is a great choice.

Another use case of Sanic is writing a “glue-web application” that can serve as a mediator between two subsystems with incompatible APIs. Note that it requires at least Python 3.5, though.

The framework is meant to be very fast. One of its dependencies is [uvloop](https://github.com/MagicStack/uvloop)—an alternative, drop-in replacement for asyncio’s not-so-good built-in event loop. Uvloop is a wrapper around libuv, the same engine that powers Node.js. According to the uvloop documentation, this makes asyncio work 2–4 times faster.

**In terms of “what’s in the box,” Sanic doesn’t offer as much as other frameworks.** It is a microframework, just like Flask. Apart from routing and other basic web-related goodies like utilities for handling cookies and streaming responses, there’s not much inside. Sanic imitates Flask, for instance by sharing the concept of Blueprints—tiny sub-applications that allow developers to split and organize their code in bigger applications.

Sanic also won’t be a good choice for simple CRUD applications that only perform basic database operations. It would just make them more complicated with no visible benefit.

## Japronto

Have you ever imagined handling 1,000,000 requests per second with Python?

It seems unreal, since Python isn’t the fastest programming language out there. But when a brilliant move was made to add asyncio to the standard library, it opened up countless possibilities.

Japronto is a microframework that leverages some of them. As a result, **this Python framework was able to cross the magical barrier of 1 million requests handled per second.**

You may still be at a loss as to how that is possible, exactly.

It all comes down to 2 aces up Japronto’s sleeve: uvloop and PicoHTTPParser. Uvloop is an asyncio backend based on libuv, while PicoHTTPParser is a lightweight HTTP headers parser written in C. All core components of the framework are also implemented in C. A wide variety of low-level optimizations and tricks are used to tweak performance.

Japronto is designed for special tasks that could not be accomplished with bloated mainstream frameworks. It is a perfect fit for problems where every nanosecond counts. Knowledgeable developers, obsessed with optimization, will reap all of its possible benefits.

Additionally, Japronto is meant to provide a solid foundation for microservices using REST APIs with minimal overhead. In other words, there’s not much in the box. Developers only need to set up routing and decide which routes should use synchronous or asynchronous handlers.

It might seem counterintuitive, but if a request can be handled in a synchronous way, you shouldn’t try to do it asynchronously, as the overhead of switching between coroutines will limit performance.

**What is quite unfortunate is that Japronto is not being actively developed.** On the other hand, the project is licensed under MIT, and the author claims he is willing to accept any contributions. Like Sanic, the framework is meant to work with Python 3.5+ versions.

## aiohttp

Aiohttp is another library based on asyncio, the modern Python toolkit for writing asynchronous code. **Not meant to be a framework in a strict sense, aiohttp is more of a toolbox, supplementing the async arsenal with everything related to HTTP.**

This means aiohttp is helpful not only for writing server applications, but also to clients. Both will benefit from asyncio’s goodies, most of all the ability to handle thousands of connections at the same time, provided the majority of operations involves I/O calls.

Such powerful clients are great when you have to issue many API calls at once, for example for scraping web pages. Without asyncio, you would have to use threading or multiprocessing, which are harder to get right and require much more memory.

Apart from building standalone applications, aiohttp’s clients are a great supplement to any asyncio-based application that needs to issue non-blocking HTTP calls. The same is true for websockets. Since they are part of the HTTP specification, you can connect to websocket servers and easily exchange messages with them.

When it comes to servers, aiohttp gives you everything you can expect from a microframework. The features available out-of-the-box include routing, middleware, and signals. It may seem like it’s very little, but it will suffice for a web server.

“What about the remaining functionalities?” you may ask.

As far as those are concerned, you can build the rest of the functionalities using one or many asyncio-compatible libraries. You will find plenty of them using sources [like this one](https://github.com/timofurrer/awesome-asyncio).

Aiohttp is built with testing in mind. Developers who want to test an aiohttp-based application will find it extremely easy, especially with the aid of pytest.

Even though aiohttp offers satisfactory performance by default, there are a few low-hanging fruits you can pick. For example, you can install additional libraries: cchardet and aiodns. Aiohttp will detect them automatically. You can also utilize the same uvloop that powers Sanic.

Last but not least: **one definite advantage of aiohttp is that it is being actively maintained and developed.** Choosing aiohttp when you build your next application will certainly be a good call.

## Twisted

With Twisted, Python developers were able to do async programming long before it was cool. Twisted is one of the oldest and most mature Python projects around.

Originally released in 2002, Twisted predates even PEP8, so the code of the project does not follow the famous code style guide recommendations. Admittedly, this may somewhat discourage people from using it these days.

Twisted’s heart is an event-driven networking engine called reactor. It is used for scheduling and calling user-defined callbacks.

In the beginning, developers had to use explicit callbacks by defining functions and passing them around separately for cases when an operation succeeded and when it failed.

Although this technique was compelling, it could also lead to what we know from early JavaScript: callback hell. In other words, the resultant code was tough to read and analyze.

**At some point, Twisted introduced inlineCallbacks—the notation for writing asynchronous code that was as simple to read as regular, synchronous code.** This solution played very well with Python’s syntax and greatly influenced modern async toolkit from the standard library, asyncio.

The greatest advantage of this framework is that although Twisted itself is just an engine with few bundled extensions, there are many additional extensions available to expand its functionality. They allow for both low-level network programming (TCP/USP) and high, application-level work (HTTP, IMAP, SHH, etc).

**This makes Twisted a perfect choice for writing specialized services; however, it is not a good candidate for regular web applications.** Developers would have to write a lot of things on their own to get the functionality they take for granted with Django.

Twisted is being actively maintained. There is an undergoing effort to migrate all of its code to be compatible with Python 3. The core functionality was rewritten some time ago, but many third-party modules are still incompatible with newer versions of the interpreter.

This may raise some concerns whether Twisted is the best choice for new projects. On the other hand, though, it is more mature than some asyncio-based solutions. Also, Twisted has been around for quite some time now, which means it will undoubtedly be maintained at least for a good while.

## Falcon

Falcon is another microframework on our list. The goal of the Falcon project is to create a minimalist foundation for building web apps where the slightest overhead matters.

Authors of the framework claim it is a **bare-metal, bloat-free toolkit for building very fast backend code and microservices.** Plus, it is compatible with both Python 2 and 3.

A big advantage of Falcon is that it is indeed very fast. Benchmarks published on its website show an incredible advantage over mainstream solutions like Django or Flask.

The downside, though, is that **Falcon offers very little to start with.** There’s routing, middlewares, hooks—and that’s basically everything. There are no extras: no validation, no authentication, etc. It is up to the developer to extend functionality as needed.

Falcon assumes it will be used for building REST APIs that talk JSON. If that is the case, you really need literally zero configuration. You can just sit down and code.

This microframework might be an exciting proposition for implementing highly-customized services that demand the highest performance possible. Falcon is an excellent choice when you don’t want or can’t invest in asyncio-based solutions.

If you’re thinking, “Sometimes the simplest solution is the best one,” you should definitely consider Falcon.

## API Star

API Star is the new kid on the block. It is yet another microframework, but this one is compatible with Python 3 only. Which is not surprising, because it leverages type hints introduced in Python 3.5.

**API Star uses type hints as a notation for building validation schemata in a concise, declarative way.** Such a schema (called a “Type” in the framework’s terminology) can then be bound to request a handling function.

Additionally, API Star features automatically generated API docs. They are compatible with OpenAPI 3. Such docs can facilitate communication between API authors and its consumers, i.e. frontend developers. If you use the Types we’ve mentioned, they are included in the API docs.

Another outstanding feature is the dependency injection mechanism. It appears to be an alternative to middlewares, but smarter and much more powerful.

For example, you can write a so-called Component that will provide our views with a currently authenticated User. On the view level, you have to explicitly state that it will require a User instance.

The rest happens behind the scenes. API Star resolves which Components have to be executed to finally run our view with all the required information.

The advantage that automatic dependency injection has over regular middlewares is that Components do not cause any overhead for the views where they are not used.

Last but not least, API Star can also be run atop asyncio in a more traditional, synchronous, WSGI-compliant way. **This makes it probably the only popular framework in the Python world capable of doing that.**

The rest of the goodies bundled with API Star are pretty standard: optional support for templating with jinja2, routing, and event hooks.

All in all, API Star looks extremely promising. At the time of writing, it has over 4,500 stars in its GitHub repository. The repository already has a few dozen contributors, and pull requests are merged daily. Many of us at STX Next are keeping our fingers crossed for this project!

## Other Python web development frameworks

There are many more Python web frameworks out there you might find interesting and useful. Each of them focuses on a different issue, was built for distinct tasks, or has a particular history.

The first that comes to mind is **Zope2,** one of the oldest frameworks, still used mainly as part of the Plone CMS. **Zope3** (later renamed BlueBream) was created as Zope2’s successor. The framework was supposed to allow for easier creation of large applications, but hasn’t won too much popularity, mainly because of the need to master fairly complex concepts (e.g. Zope Component Architecture) very early in the learning process.

Also noteworthy is the **Google App Engine,** which allows you to run applications written in Python, among others. This platform lets you create applications in any framework compatible with WSGI. The SDK for the App Engine includes a simple framework called webapp2, and this exact approach is often used in web applications adapted to this environment.

Another interesting example is **Tornado,** developed by FriendFeed and made available by Facebook. This framework includes libraries supporting asynchronicity, so you can build applications that support multiple simultaneous connections (like long polling or WebSocket).

Other libraries similar to Tornado include **Pulsar** (async) and **Gevent** (greenlet). These libraries allow you to build any network applications (multiplayer games and chat rooms, for example). They also perform well at handling HTTP requests.

Developing applications using these frameworks and libraries is more difficult and requires you to explore some harder-to-grasp concepts. We recommend getting to them later on, as you venture deeper into the wonderful world of Python.

825,"Hello everyone. My name is Andrew and for several years I've been working on to make the learning path for ML easier. I wrote a manual on machine learning that everyone understands - Machine Learning Simplified Book.

The main purpose of my book is to build **an intuitive understanding** of how algorithms work through basic examples. In order to understand the presented material, it is enough to know basic mathematics and linear algebra.

After reading this book, you will know the basics of supervised learning, understand complex mathematical models, understand the entire pipeline of a typical ML project, and also be able to share your knowledge with colleagues from related industries and with technical professionals.

And for those who find the theoretical part not enough - I supplemented the book with a repository on **GitHub**, which has Python implementation of every method and algorithm that I describe in each chapter ([https://github.com/5x12/themlsbook](https://github.com/5x12/themlsbook)).

You can read the book absolutely free at the link below: -&gt; [https://themlsbook.com](https://themlsbook.com/)

I would appreciate it if you recommend my book to those who might be interested in this topic, as well as for any feedback provided. Thanks! (attaching one of the pipelines described in the book).;

839,"So, I know I’m going to get a good amount of hate from this post. But that’s okay. I’m still happy to share my gratitude.

But before I start, here’s a couple things to take into account. One, this is my alt account, since I would prefer not to have this post on my main account. Second, even though I’ve been coding for 3 years, I’m not that far ahead. I’ve been moving pretty slowly, and only work on it every Saturday for some amount of time. The rest of my week is spent working on my blog, doing school, with friends, and doing chores.

Ok, so now I’ll begin. I’ve been coding for 3 years. I started looking at Reddit about a year and a half ago, just online when I didn’t have an account. Then I made an account, and started learning a ton of this subreddit.

I already have an idea for my career, because if YOU. I can’t believe I actually can do this. I know so many people that are 35 and work at Cookout, so the fact you guys helped me find my dream career just blows my mind. 

I’m currently learning Data Science, which plan on learning Machine Learning after. I’ve learned the basics, all the way up to classes and such, as well as search algorithms to create AIs. My most recent one was an AI that solved an 8-Puzzle, using A* Search. Where did I learn about this algorithm? On this subreddit.

Now I’ve never been the best at writing, so I’m running out of ideas in what to say. But I just wanted to let you know that you just made a lost, depressed 13 year old with anxiety, go to a happy, passionate 13 year old with career ahead of him.

That’s all I have to say, so goodbye :)

Edit: Well now I have another thing to thank you for. For all the support you’ve given me. I thought I would be getting a good amount of hate, but I haven’t seen any so far! It’s really motivated me to keep practicing and work on new projects, so thanks!

844,"It started with an idea: *""Since Python objects store their methods/fields in* ***\_\_dict\_\_****, that means that* ***dictionaries/hash tables power the entire language.*** That means that Python spends a significant portion of its time hashing data. What would happen if the hash function Python used was swapped out with a much faster one? ***Would it speed up CPython?****""*

So I set off to find out.

The first experiment I ran was to find out how many times the hash function is used within a single print(""Hello World!"") statement. **Python runs the hash function 11 times for just this one thing!**

Clearly, a faster hash function would help at least a little bit.

I chose [xxHash](https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash) as the ""faster"" hash function to test out since it is a single header file and is easy to compile.

I swapped out the default hash function used in the Py\_hash\_t \_Py\_HashBytes(const void \*src, Py\_ssize\_t len) function to use the xxHash function XXH64.

*The results were astounding.*

I created a [simple benchmark](https://github.com/Pebaz/cpython/blob/master/benchmark.py) (targeted at hashing performance), and ran it:

**CPython with xxHash hashing function was 62-76% faster!**

I believe the results of this experiment are worth exploring by a CPython contributor expert.

[Here is the code](https://github.com/Pebaz/cpython) for this for anyone that wants to see whether or not to try to spend the time to do this right (perhaps not using xxHash specifically for example). The only changes I made were copy-pasting the xxhash.h file into the [include directory](https://github.com/Pebaz/cpython/blob/master/Include/xxhash.h) and using the [XXH64 hashing function](https://github.com/Pebaz/cpython/blob/5de1728ca8697461d6fc3aa6bbcf656f6145acf1/Python/pyhash.c#L203) in the \_Py\_HashBytes() function.

I want to caveat the code changes by saying that I am not an expert C programmer, nor was this a serious effort, nor was the macro-benchmark by any means accurate (they never are). This was simply a proof of concept for food for thought for the experts that work on CPython every day and it may not even be useful.

**Again, I'd like to stress that this was just food for thought, and that all benchmarks are inaccurate.**

However, I hope this helps the Python community as it would be awesome to have this high of a speed boost.",mgi4op,Reddit - r/Python
845,"I was walking along the sidewalk yesterday thinking about how frustrated I used to get not knowing how to do the most basic programming. Then I realized that in a single day I had written a script that would have taken me months prior. 

Right then I stopped, smiled and danced a little. I found myself realizing that I had really understood the code, that I had thought logically about solutions to the problem I needed to automate, and I implemented problem solving without having to look many things up on stack overflow. 

It’s been about a year now since I’ve started my graduate research assistantship at the university. I pretty much got thrown in head first. 
The first day they handed me 80 Gigabytes of satellite data and told me to go read 18 pixels from each of the individual files. I was so discouraged but I kept on going and just put one foot in front of the other. 

I made the deadlines with code that functioned. I turned in products and accepted the criticism. I went home feeling like shit a lot and feeling discouraged. But today, I feel like it was all worth it. 

I say all of this to just be a voice of encouragement to all the new folks out there. You can do this. As Dory from the finding Nemo would say, “just keep swimming.” Keep going friends.

846,"Hello everyone!

I'm Richard S. aka ichard26 and I'm one of the core team responsible for psf/black ([repo](https://github.com/psf/black), [docs](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable)), a project dedicated to making sure your ~~car~~ code is painted black. Black is notable for its general lack of configuration and secondary focus on reducing diff noise.

This AMA will be at least (we have a sizable team of 9 folks) joined by

* [Łukasz Langa](https://github.com/ambv) \-- creator, maintainer &amp; BDFL
* [Jelle Zijlstra](https://github.com/JelleZijlstra), /u/ucucha \-- maintainer
* [Zsolt Dollenstein](https://github.com/zsol) \-- maintainer
* [me](https://github.com/ichard26)! -- maintainer

**The official start time for the AMA will be 17:00pm UTC**, before then this post will exist to collect questions in advance. Since we live all over North America and Europe, **it's likely we'll answer questions before &amp; after the official start time by a significant margin**.

Black allows you to write your Python code however you like, and let it handle fixing your coding style for others, making it easier to just program and avoid time hunting down where your code violates style guide rules.

I can't really comment on the early bits of the project's life as I only joined in mid-2020 so here's a quote from Łukasz Langa, both the creator and BDLF:

&gt;At the time I was working for Facebook on their internal use of Python. There were over 20 million lines of code maintained and too much time during code review was wasted fighting over formatting. Plus different projects ended up having muuuch different coding styles, including some ex-Googlers forcing use of 2-spaced indents in their favorite projects. It was a mess.  
&gt;  
&gt;At first I tried adopting an existing code formatter, YAPF. \[...\] However, we couldn't make it work for our 20 million lines of code. It was very configurable but also very inconsistent because of it. \[...\]  
&gt;  
&gt;So I started working on my own. ""How hard can it be?"" Well, it took me 6 weeks to get to the first alpha release. When I put it out on March 14th 2018 (Pi Day!), it got 500 GitHub stars in one day, Kenneth Reitz started using it right away and tweeted about it, and soon after we got pretty big adoption.

And after a few short years, it's become the most popular autoformatter for Python. FWIW just only a few days ago Black surpassed 100 million downloads on PyPI, but Black isn't stopping anytime soon. It'll still exist painting code in layers of black paint!

If you want to see how Black would reformat your code, [you can try it online](https://black.vercel.app/) and paste your code to see how it changes.

Ask us anything! Post your questions and upvote the ones you think are the most important and should get our ~~paintbrushes~~ replies.

848,"Hello,

TLDR: Managed to automate something practical which is a milestone for me.

I recently found some resources I wanted to use on the net. I wanted to pull the pages to pdf or some other file type so as to have it on my kindle and just have it available offline. The issue was the resources are some 500 pages and are scripted so using wget was getting me nowhere as the content of the page wasn't being downloaded. I had previously tried querying the net for a solution to this but had at that point come up empty.

Instead I decided to use python and the pyautogui and make a script that would perform the command inputs through keyboard and mouse... aaaaaand.... it works!

I've so far managed to get through 3/5 of the resources with this. And the best thing is I don't have to do it myself.

Is it pretty? Its not ugly, but its not having an open casket funeral.

Does it work perfectly? No, I have to sit and glance over on it every few minutes to make sure it hasn't caught itself in some sort of loop driven by the existential dread of realization that this is all this program is going to do.

but does it work? YES!

And to be honest I can't be more proud of it for that reason. I've written some code that has untied my hands and is allowing me to work while it does its job. This is the first time I've been able to accomplish this in the 5 or so years I've had my on/off relationship with coding. All it took was a couple of hours of tinkering and getting things just right. Way less than if I would have to do it by hand. And I have to add that I enjoyed this as a process. Finding all the edge cases that made it not work, adapting it so it would process the commands functionally, dodging pitfalls because of differences from page to page. I mean it even uses the copy paste function of pyperclip to test text in different parts of the page to determine what it should do.

I also did it in python. Which is kind of surprising to me. Mostly because I don't really like python.

Well, I enjoy using it, cause of how simple and adaptive it is. But I just don't enjoy the structure or the method of invoking classes etc. It may be similar to the other languages I've been using, but its just not my cup of coffee. This experience just proved to me it's not about the language itself, its about how you use it and I won't be dropping python any time soon.

I just wanted to write this post because I think I've reached a milestone in coding that has previously eluded me and that is practical application of coding to make my day a little easier and I couldn't have achieved it without python and the python community.",psfdnh,Reddit - r/Python

During my application to an internship that required me to build the control system of robots using Python, I lied to my recruiter about already possessing beginner-level programming skills in python.

Thankfully, he didn't ask me anything else and accepted me for the internship program. But since that day, I have religiously practiced Python every day in my life, so that I wouldn't have to lie to anyone else!

In my beginner days, I did the whole dance to learn Python.

I did a lot of free courses on the internet.

I solved every problem I could find on any Python topic again and again. And then again!

Initially, I only did it to do excel at my thesis. But eventually, I fell in love with this simple language.

So much so that I started applying for Python programming jobs even before my Masters in Transportation Engineering got over and happily accepted the job offer when I got one.

Websites I followed for learning
I would like to provide the list of websites, that were of great help when I began programming.

**[A brief taste of what we're doing](https://twitter.com/Sentdex/status/854394799104962561)**

..or check out the latest video in the series: **[a more interesting self-driving AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWJZ4w0HKz8)**, especially near the end. 

This is by no means a serious look into self-driving vehicles, it's just for fun, and so far the latest project has been to make a motorcycle that speeds through traffic, attempting to stay on the road and evading all the other slow drivers. 

We do all of this with basic(ish...) tools and concepts. We're reading the screen by taking screenshots with pywin32, seeing about 20 FPS with the neural network, sending keys with direct input, and then doing some analysis with OpenCV, otherwise also training with a convolutional neural network in TensorFlow. 

The goal of the series is more to show you how you can take just about whatever game you want, mapping the screen to inputs, training a neural network, and then letting the network play the game. 

It's an ongoing project, and is also **[open-source](https://github.com/sentdex/pygta5/)**

Here's a link to the **[self-driving tutorials](https://pythonprogramming.net/game-frames-open-cv-python-plays-gta-v/)**, which starts at the beginning.

A couple of years ago I released ""Slither into Python"" for free online which was an introduction to Python for complete beginners. I released it for free as a thank you to the Python community in general. You can view that [here](https://www.slitherintopython.com).

The feedback was amazing (thank you all, I'm delighted you enjoyed it!). It inspired me to write another book that I felt was the natural extension to it - focusing on data structures and algorithms. In fact, I had a lot of requests for it after the last two chapters of that book so that inspired me even more to write this.

I had started on it a while back but work became super busy and last year happened so I kind of forgot about it. However I recently came across the files and decided to pick it back up.

It's now complete: ""Slither into Data Structures and Algorithms: A concise guide to the backbone of the digital world through Python"" and you can check it out here: [slitherintoalgorithms.com](https://slitherintoalgorithms.com).

The chapter on Graphs is up and free to read on the site! Again, I'd like to thank everyone on this subreddit that gave such amazing feedback and improvements for my last book.

EDIT: Thank you for the awards!

EDIT: It's been pointed out a couple of times so I'll address it here. On a second look, the title of this post may be a bit misleading, unfortunately I can't change the title. This book is NOT free. I've kept the cost of it as low as possible and is a fraction of the cost of other books on this topic. However, with the hosting, SSL and domain costs for both this new book and the beginners book (which is free), it is unsustainable for me to release this one for free too.

**Edit:**

I just woke up and I read all your constructive feedback. WOW, this is why I love Reddit sometimes. I will try and implement all the tips and tricks to my app.

Quick question (I woke up with this idea), if I wanted to add a dictionary to my app, to check if the word is a real word, is it easily achievable?

&amp;#x200B;

**Background:**

I am a High School dropout and I have no degree. I started working in IT about 8 years ago and made my way to being a System Administrator for a small Supermarket chain. I am new to Python and the only language I know a little of is Powershell.

**Why I want to learn Python:**

There are not a lot of practical skills that I learned on my own. So on December 28th, I decided to put my energy into learning how to code. I saw a post in r/powershell : [Powershell Guide to Python](https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerShell/comments/ab27n2/book_update_powershell_guide_to_python/) by  [u/Prateeksingh1590](https://www.reddit.com/user/Prateeksingh1590) and decided I wanted to learn Python. So I watched 2.5 hours out of the 4 hours from [this video for beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw&amp;t=12978s). I also watched 2 hours of a [Lynda.com](https://Lynda.com) course, mainly reviewing what I had learned from [Mike Dane](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ).

**The App:**

At one point, I wanted to know if I could code an app with the little basic knowledge I had. I thought about building an guessing word game. So I layed out want I wanted to achieve. I wanted the person guessing to have 3 information while guessing a word :

1 - To know if the have more, less or equal the characters of the word

2 - To know if they have some letters right

3 - To if the letters that are right are in the right spot

**Making the App:**

So I started my journey to make this app. It took me over a week and about 8-10 hours of trials and errors and googling to achieve the app. Watch out for yourself, it's pretty ugly. but it works.

**Feedback is more than welcome**

914,"Have you ever been curious about the several meanings of underscores in Python? A little break-down?

*- you can find detailed explanations and code snippets* [*here*](https://towardsdatascience.com/whats-the-meaning-of-single-and-double-underscores-in-python-3d27d57d6bd1)

1️⃣ single leading underscore (""\_var""): indicates that the variable is meant for internal use. This is not enforced by the interpreter and is rather a hint to the programmer.

2️⃣ single trailing underscore (""var\_""): it's used to avoid conflicts with Python reserved keywords (""class\_"", ""def\_"", etc.)

3️⃣ double leading underscores (""\_\_var""): Triggers name mangling when used in a class context and is enforced by the Python interpreter.   
What this means is that it should be used to avoid your method is being overridden by a subclass or accessed accidentally.

4️⃣ double leading and trailing underscores (""\_\_var\_\_""): used for special methods defined in the Python language (ex. \_\_init\_\_, \_\_len\_\_, \_\_call\_\_, etc.). They should be avoided to use for your own attributes.

5️⃣ single underscore (""\_""): Generally used as a temporary or unused variable. (If you don't use the running index of a for-loop, you can replace it with ""\_"").",scbhnq,Reddit - r/Python

A couple of days ago there was a post on this subreddit that showed a Python calculator in 17 lines of code ([this is the post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/ofr75b/i_made_a_calculator_with_17_lines_of_code/)). I took that to an extreme and condensed that into a calculator that is a single expression in Python.

Notice that a single expression and a single line aren't the same thing, expressions are even smaller parts. A single line can contain multiple expressions and statements. An expression can't contain any of that.

Here is what we started with:

    from tkinter import *
    
    def bt_draw(key, col, lin):
        bt = Button(window, text=key, command=lambda: bt_press(key))
        bt.grid(column=col+1, row=lin+1)
        return bt
    
    def bt_press(key):
        if   key == ""C"": disp[""text""] = """"
        elif key == ""&lt;"": disp[""text""] = disp[""text""][:-1]
        elif key == ""="": disp[""text""] = str(round(eval(disp[""text""]), 6))
        else           : disp[""text""] += key
    
    window = Tk()
    window.title(""TKalc"")
    
    disp = Label(window, text="""")
    print(disp.grid(column=0, row=0, columnspan=5))
    
    keys = ""()C&lt;789/456*123-.0=+""
    bt_list = [bt_draw(keys[n], n%4, n//4) for n in range(20)]
    
    window.mainloop()

Here is the final code:

    (tk := __import__(""tkinter"")) and (bt_draw := lambda k, c, l: (bt := tk.Button(w, text=k, command=lambda: bt_press(k), width=6)) and bt.grid(column=c, row=l) or bt) and (update := lambda t: d.config(text=t)) and (bt_press := lambda k: update("""") if k == ""C"" else update(d[""text""][:-1]) if k == ""&lt;"" else update(str(round(eval(d[""text""]), 6))) if k == ""="" else update(d[""text""] + k)) and (w := tk.Tk()) and w.title(""TKalc"") or (d := tk.Label(w, text="""")) and d.grid(column=0, row=0, columnspan=5) or [bt_draw(k, n%4 + 1, n//4 + 1) for n, k in enumerate(""()C&lt;789/456*123-.0=+"")] and w.mainloop()

[GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/RojerGS/3b3d301710da3da80ece693de068e3c9)

**Here is how I did it:**

First things first, we clean up the code a bit:

* starred imports aren't generally a good idea and we only need 3 things, so import those or import `tkinter` by itself;
* the list comprehension in the end should really use an `enumerate` ([writing Pythonic code with `enumerate`](https://mathspp.com/blog/pydonts/enumerate-me));
* it doesn't make much sense to increment the row and column of the buttons when creating them, the `bt_draw` function should be called with the correct arguments;
* we add some width to the buttons when we create them, otherwise the calculator looks *really* bad (might be because of my operating system).

We get this:

    import tkinter as tk
    
    def bt_draw(key, col, lin):
        bt = tk.Button(window, text=key, command=lambda: bt_press(key), width=5)
        bt.grid(column=col, row=lin)
        return bt
    
    def bt_press(key):
        if   key == ""C"": disp[""text""] = """"
        elif key == ""&lt;"": disp[""text""] = disp[""text""][:-1]
        elif key == ""="": disp[""text""] = str(round(eval(disp[""text""]), 6))
        else           : disp[""text""] += key
    
    window = tk.Tk()
    window.title(""TKalc"")
    
    disp = tk.Label(window, text="""")
    disp.grid(column=0, row=0, columnspan=5)
    
    keys = ""()C&lt;789/456*123-.0=+""
    bt_list = [bt_draw(k, n%4 + 1, n//4 + 1) for n, k in enumerate(keys)]
    
    window.mainloop()

Now on to rewriting everything as a single expression. First I rewrote the functions as lambdas, which means right from the start that I have to use [Boolean short-circuiting](https://mathspp.com/blog/pydonts/boolean-short-circuiting) to be able to stuff different expressions together.

The first function was:

    def bt_draw(key, col, lin):
        bt = Button(window, text=key, command=lambda: bt_press(key), width=5)
        bt.grid(column=col+1, row=lin+1)
        return bt

and became

    bt_draw = lambda k, c, l: (bt := Button(w, text=k, command=lambda: bt_press(k), width=5)) and bt.grid(column=col, row=lin)

Notice that assignments are statements, not expressions, so we need to use [assignment expressions with the walrus operator](https://mathspp.com/blog/pydonts/assignment-expressions-and-the-walrus-operator) if we want to inline assignments. We don't really need to return the button for any reason, so we can just ignore the `return bt` statement, otherwise we would end our lambda with `or bt`.

The second function is a little bit more work because the `if`\-`elif` statements need to be rewritten as conditional expressions. On top of that, `disp[""text""]` can't be the left-hand side of an assignment expression, so we need to work this out in some other way... just call the `config` function!

We go from

    def bt_press(key):
        if   key == ""C"": disp[""text""] = """"
        elif key == ""&lt;"": disp[""text""] = disp[""text""][:-1]
        elif key == ""="": disp[""text""] = str(round(eval(disp[""text""]), 6))
        else           : disp[""text""] += key

to

    update = lambda t: d.config(text=t)
    bt_press = lambda k: update("""") if k == ""C"" else update(d[""text""][:-1]) if k == ""&lt;"" else update(str(round(eval(d[""text""]), 6))) if k == ""="" else update(d[""text""] + k)

Notice that we also factored out the ""update"" part of the logic into a single function, to separate concerns. If we later change how text is displayed, it becomes more manageable to also update the way in which we update the text, we just need to fix the `update` function.

At this point, this is the program:

    import tkinter as tk
    bt_draw = lambda k, c, l: (bt := tk.Button(w, text=k, command=lambda: bt_press(k), width=5)) and bt.grid(column=c, row=l)
    update = lambda t: d.config(text=t)
    bt_press = lambda k: update("""") if k == ""C"" else update(d[""text""][:-1]) if k == ""&lt;"" else update(str(round(eval(d[""text""]), 6))) if k == ""="" else update(d[""text""] + k)
    w = tk.Tk()
    w.title(""TKalc"")
    d = tk.Label(w, text="""")
    d.grid(column=0, row=0, columnspan=5)
    keys = ""()C&lt;789/456*123-.0=+""
    bt_list = [bt_draw(k, n%4 + 1, n//4 + 1) for n, k in enumerate(keys)]
    w.mainloop()

The final hassle is the `tkinter` import, because we are currently using an import *statement*... However, we can easily fix that with the `__import__` built-in:

    tk = __import__(""tkinter"")

Now we just chain everything together in a single expression with `and`s and `or`s. All the assignments are changed into `:=` and chained together with `and`s. After calls to functions that don't return anything, for example the `.grid()` methods, we use `or`s to keep the program going.",ojab0n,Reddit - r/Python

932,"I'm not sure if that's a stupid question but considering how much time, and therefore money, some simple scripts could save the average business I don't understand why I don't see ""X Automation Services"" everywhere.

Before I knew any programming I worked for a small company that sold hundreds of second hand items via their own website and eBay. They spent at least 2 hours a day posting/deleting products and making sure everything matched between the two sites. That's over 40 hours a month that could be saved by a relatively simple Beautiful Soup/Selenium solution.

These scenarios are not rare, any business I've ever known has repetitive tasks that can be automated and save countless hours in the long run. Even if there is a relatively simple solution on the market you could at least direct them to that service and charge a consultation fee and even help implement it. Something like Zapier, which seems obvious to us, is intimidating to some of the less tech savvy small business owners. Simply setting up a few useful Zaps would warrrent a decent fee IMO.

One thing I haven't figured out is how you would go about pricing. For my above example let's say my script could save the owner £4,000 a year — what is a reasonable one off fee? The other option is to charge monthly but that would be difficult if you are going to just hand over a script with a batch file or something.

2. Similarly, the returns % is calculated without accounting inflation or dividends
3. The bot doesn't quite support intra-day trading. So a mention like ""Remind me of $BTC in one hour"" will generate the initial reply but the bot won't trigger the reminder unless the bot is mentioned before midday UTC.

943,"Hey r/Python! Today, I wanted to make a post about a recent project I took upon myself (This is my first ""major"" project). This project is both a mixture of math, and computer science and I thought it was worth sharing here.

Install libmaths on PyPi or from my GitHub: [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/libmaths/) | [GitHub Repo](https://www.github.com/Simple2006/libmaths)

**If you have  GitHub account, please star the repository. I'd greatly appreciate it.**

Three days ago, I decided to create my own Python library as a 14-year old high school student, [libmaths](https://pypi.org/project/libmaths/). I've always used them but something I never understood was how they were made or where they were coming from. I did the research on how to design my library and publish it and immediately started.  I plan on maintaining the library and dealing with any issues or concerns everyday.

An issue I thought  mathematicians faced in programming was the incapability to draw graphs and models in a short period of time within their code.  With some research, I gathered a list of functions I wanted to implement to begin with. I have no calculus experience but I was determined to add a couple calculus functions. I needed a lot of help to understand the math and google came pretty clutch.

**libmaths is an extremely efficient library allowing the user a smooth experience in graphing and modeling functions. From linear functions all the way to sextic functions and much more, libmaths has it all.**

In the GitHub repository, examples for every single function are provided as well as the file itself if you would like to play around with the values or change code yourself.

If there's one thing I learned from this experience, it's that math and computer science put together can be an amazing tool and there's no limit to how much you can learn with the internet.

To anyone trying to pursue coding, there's plenty of resources on the internet and considering we are already in the r/Python subreddit, you can also put math to use in your code!

I had an algorithm in mind and was using a list to track the books I had already scanned, and was checking if the next book I scanned was present in that list. In python, the ""in"" keyword has a time complexity of O(n). This slowed down my program by a LOT, as there were MANY books. So each test run used to take me around 2-3 minutes on my potato laptop. So I was losing a lot of time testing my code.

Then I discovered these things called sets in python. The time complexity of ""in"" for sets is O(1) or constant time. After I changed the list to a set and replaced all the ""append"" with ""add"" and ran the program, it finished executing in less than 2 seconds. 

So always, ALWAYS, look for a better tool for your job. I was a huge beginner to data structure and algo based questions, and after solving the problem, I got a score of about 26 million, which placed me at the 881st place globally (This was after the qualification round was over, after which everyone had an opportunity to try the challenge for a week iirc).

# 1. Check for Uniqueness in Python List

This method can be used to check if there are duplicate items in a given list.

Refer to the code below:

    # Let's leverage set()
    def all_unique(lst):
        return len(lst) == len(set(lst))
    
    y = [1,2,3,4,5]
    print(all_unique(x))
    print(all_unique(y))

# 2. anagram()

An anagram in the English language is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of another word or phrase.

The anagram() method can be used to check if two Strings are anagrams.

    from collections import Counter
    
    def anagram(first, second):
        return Counter(first) == Counter(second)
    
    anagram(""abcd3"", ""3acdb"")

# 3. Memory

This can be used to check the memory usage of an object:

    import sys 
    variable = 30 
    print(sys.getsizeof(variable))

# 4. Size in Bytes

The method shown below returns the length of the String in bytes:

    def byte_size(string):
        return(len(string.encode('utf-8')))
    print(byte_size('?'))
    print(byte_size('Hello World'))

# 5. Print the String n Times

This snippet can be used to display String n times without using loops:

    n = 2; 
    s = ""Programming""
    print(s * n);

# 6. Convert the First Letters of Words to Uppercase

The snippet uses a method title() to capitalize each word in a String:

    s = ""programming is awesome""
    print(s.title()) # Programming Is Awesome

# 7. Separation

This method splits the list into smaller lists of the specified size:

    def chunk(list, size):
        return [list[i:i+size] for i in range(0,len(list), size)]
    lstA = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
    lstSize = 3
    chunk(lstA, lstSize)

# 8. Removal of False Values

So you remove the false values (False, None, 0, and ‘’) from the list using filter() method:

    def compact(lst):
        return list(filter(bool, lst))
    compact([0, 1, False, 2, '',' ', 3, 'a', 's', 34])

# 9. To Count

This is done as demonstrated below:

    array = [['a', 'b'], ['c', 'd'], ['e', 'f']]
    transposed = zip(*array)
    [print(i) for i in transposed]

# 10. Chain Comparison

You can do multiple comparisons with all kinds of operators in one line as shown below:

    a = 3
    print( 2 &lt; a &lt; 8) # True
    print(1 == a &lt; 2) # False

# 11. Separate With Comma

Convert a list of Strings to a single String, where each item from the list is separated by commas:

    hobbies = [""singing"", ""soccer"", ""swimming""]
    print(""My hobbies are:"") # My hobbies are:
    print("", "".join(hobbies)) # singing, soccer, swimming

# 12. Count the Vowels

This method counts the number of vowels (“a”, “e”, “i”, “o”, “u”) found in the String:

    import re
    def count_vowels(value):
        return len(re.findall(r'[aeiou]', value, re.IGNORECASE))
    print(count_vowels('foobar')) # 3
    print(count_vowels('gym')) # 0

# 13. Convert the First Letter of a String to Lowercase

Use the lower() method to convert the first letter of your specified String to lowercase:

    def decapitalize(string):
        return string[:1].lower() + string[1:]
    print(decapitalize('FooBar')) # 'fooBar'

# 14. Anti-aliasing

The following methods flatten out a potentially deep list using recursion:

    newList = [1,2]
    newList.extend([3,5])
    newList.append(7)
    print(newList)
    def spread(arg):
        ret = []
        for i in arg:
            if isinstance(i, list):
                ret.extend(i)
            else:
                ret.append(i)
        return ret
    def deep_flatten(xs):
        flat_list = []
        [flat_list.extend(deep_flatten(x)) for x in xs] if isinstance(xs, list) else flat_list.append(xs)
        return flat_list
    deep_flatten([1, [2], [[3], 4], 5]) # [1,2,3,4,5]

# 15. difference()

This method finds the difference between the two iterations, keeping only the values that are in the first:

    def difference(a, b):
        set_a = set(a)
        set_b = set(b)
        comparison = set_a.difference(set_b)
        return list(comparison)
    difference([1,2,3], [1,2,4]) # [3]

# 16. The Difference Between Lists

The following method returns the difference between the two lists after applying this function to each element of both lists:

    def difference_by(a, b, fn):
        b = set(map(fn, b))
        return [item for item in a if fn(item) not in b]
    from math import floor
    print(difference_by([2.1, 1.2], [2.3, 3.4],floor)) # [1.2]
    print(difference_by([{ 'x': 2 }, { 'x': 1 }], [{ 'x': 1 }], lambda v : v['x'])) # [ { x: 2 } ]

# 17. Chained Function Call

You can call multiple functions in one line:

    def add(a, b):
        return a + b
    def subtract(a, b):
        return a - b
    a, b = 4, 5
    print((subtract if a &gt; b else add)(a, b)) # 9

# 18. Find Duplicates

This code checks to see if there are duplicate values ​​in the list using the fact that the set only contains unique values:

    def has_duplicates(lst):
        return len(lst) != len(set(lst))
    x = [1,2,3,4,5,5]
    y = [1,2,3,4,5]
    print(has_duplicates(x)) # True
    print(has_duplicates(y)) # False

# 19. Combine Two Dictionaries

The following method can be used to combine two dictionaries:

    def merge_dictionaries(a, b):
        return {**a,**b}
    a = { 'x': 1, 'y': 2}
    b = { 'y': 3, 'z': 4}
    print(merge_dictionaries(a, b)) # {'y': 3, 'x': 1, 'z': 4}

# 20. Convert Two Lists to a Dictionary

Now let’s get down to converting two lists into a dictionary:

    def merge_dictionaries(a, b):
        return {**a,**b}
    a = { 'x': 1, 'y': 2}
    b = { 'y': 3, 'z': 4}
    print(merge_dictionaries(a, b)) # {'y': 3, 'x': 1, 'z': 4}
    
    def to_dictionary(keys, values):
        return dict(zip(keys, values))
    keys = [""a"", ""b"", ""c""]    
    values = [2, 3, 4]
    print(to_dictionary(keys, values)) # {'a': 2, 'c': 4, 'b': 3}

I was tired of the long tutorial videos on YouTube, most of which have long intros and outros with just a few minutes of actual content. Also, as I am a JEE aspirant I barely get an hour a day to invest in programming. So, I came up with a creative way to help people like me learn new programming concepts by just investing a minute or two, and be able to dedicate the rest of there spare time in practice projects.

The [playlist](https://youtu.be/LMZy8CWkzv8?list=PLgcPkjjUGSoQPdUBzATcXfIs1womEW2cb&amp;index=1) is still a work-in-progress, but I have currently uploaded 23 videos, and I update almost every day. I am also working on the same kind of playlist for JavaScript. I have made the videos in a way that not only does it serve as a learning material for beginners, but also as a reference material for intermediate users.

As I'm just starting out with YouTube, I would highly appreciate any suggestions or criticisms from the sub (topic suggestions will also be really helpful).",oom4yl,Reddit - r/Python

965,"I'm not super experienced in Python \-\- my main programming language is Java, but I learned Python from a CS course I took last semester.  I love programming, but I also really love hip hop music.  I typically find this music by looking at a website called Hot New Hip Hop, which keeps a list of the top 100 new songs at any given time.  There are a select number of artists who I like, and a lot of the time the tracks are too new to be on Spotify.

To save myself time, I automated my process of searching for and discovering new music.  I used Windows Task Scheduler to schedule a script to run every morning, scrape the top 100 songs page, and add songs to a playlist if they're made by artists I like and are on Spotify.  I also used a SQLite database to store my Spotify client and access tokens, as well as prevent adding duplicate songs.  This script will probably save me about 45 minutes to an hour each week, which is pretty sweet.

983,"Just thought I'd share this little lesson I learned today - sometimes you program really clever things that are actually bad and redundant to your program. Don't be afraid to cut into it when necessary. 

My program starts with a pre-load cache of a lot of data that the program will normally use, but just in case it uses something not yet loaded, I also wrote a small function that loads the missing data on-demand into the cache. Well everything worked but the program took about 25 seconds to load, which was annoying. I spent the whole day today trying to find clever ways to load the data faster - and came up with a bunch of possible solutions - the fastest of which was loading everything concurrently with threads.

It still was kind of slow. Just at the end of the day the solution came to me - I could delete all the pre-load nonsense and the ""cache on-demand"" will just do the work if and when it's needed. It worked perfectly. The loading time at the start went from 25 seconds to 2 seconds, and everything else was running perfectly (with a tiny lag here and there when data is being loaded for the first time). It only created one small bug that could be fixed by adding one line of code.

Anyway, that's how I spent the whole day programming and ended up just removing lines.",e0jxks,Reddit - r/Python
984," Had a noteworthy event at work today. I have an internship with Amazon for the summer, but it with the Data Center Operations divisions. So working with servers mostly. But I found a way to make an impression on my manager today using Python. I can't go into specific details of what we were working on (NDA and confidentiality and all) but I can talk about what I did. 

We were working with a large number of assets (327 total) and part of that work involved compiling information about those assets. Well as an intern I get all the crap jobs. So I got handed that job. So for 2 days, I've been working on compiling the info in a spreadsheet. Thought I was finished but found I only had information for 319 assets. Well, we can't just 'lose' 8 assets. That kind of looks bad on a record. So my manager wanted me to go through the list of total assets and figure out what 8 we didn't have info for. I'm like 99% sure he was expecting me to go line by line in excel and do a CTRL+F to see which ones from the total list weren't on the info list. A nice little process that would likely have taken me the better part of the day to accomplish.   

Instead, I pulled up python, threw together a script to build 2 lists (one for total assets, one for the information I had compiled) and then compare the lists. Anything it found in the totals list that it didn't find in the info list got dumped to a text file.  

Total time: 18 minutes (I had to look up some info on the xlswriter module).

I have both a 2018 Macbook pro and a 2016 Thinkpad t470s running Linux.

The Thinkpad has a [7th gen Intel Core I-7  i7-7500U with a max frequency of 3.5GHz](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/95451/intel-core-i7-7500u-processor-4m-cache-up-to-3-50-ghz.html)

Despite the Macbook having a faster processor in every way (and more impressive harware all around), I noticed that some things just seem sluggish with it, like opening an iPython terminal, on the Macbook compared to the Thinkpad.

So I decided to run some actual benchmark suite. I found [pyperformance](https://github.com/python/pyperformance) which would seem to do the trick. 

I ran the suite on both machines, same Python version (3.9.6) with no other running applications. Sure enough, here are the results:

The Linux machine was faster in every benchmark (except for one where it was 35x slower). Not what you would expect if only taking hardware into account.

I've heard that python compiled with GCC may be more optimized then LLVM which the MacOS build was built with. Could this really account for the stark performance difference?",oouh9a,Reddit - r/Python

990,"Representing over two years of work from the Pallets team and contributors, new major versions Flask, Werkzeug, Jinja, Click, ItsDangerous, and MarkupSafe have been released on May 11, 2021. Check out our announcement on our blog: [https://palletsprojects.com/blog/flask-2-0-released/](https://palletsprojects.com/blog/flask-2-0-released/), and retweet it to spread the word on Twitter as well: [https://twitter.com/PalletsTeam/status/1392266507296514048](https://twitter.com/PalletsTeam/status/1392266507296514048)

Every project has significant changes, and while we don't anticipate breaking things, it may take some time for extensions and other projects to catch up. Be sure to use tools like pip-compile and Dependabot to pin your dependencies and control when you upgrade.

Overall changes to every project include:

* Drop Python 2 and Python 3.5 support. Python 3.6 and above is required, the latest version is recommended. Removing the compatibility code also gives a nice speedup.
* Add comprehensive type annotations to all the libraries.
* Better new contributor experience with updated contributing guide and consistent code style with tools like pre-commit and black.

Check out the changelog links for each project to see all of the great new features and changes. I've included some of the highlights here as well.

* [Flask 2.0](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/changes/#version-2-0-0)
   * `async def` views and callbacks.
   * Nested blueprints.
   * Shortcut HTTP method route decorators like `@app.post()` and `@app.delete()`.
   * Static files like CSS will show changes immediately instead of needing to clear the cache.
* [Werkzeug 2.0](https://werkzeug.palletsprojects.com/changes/#version-2-0-0)
   * `multipart/form-data` is parsed *15x* faster, especially for large file uploads.
   * Getting ready for async support behind the scenes.
   * Improved test client experience.
   * Routing understands websocket URLs.
* [Jinja 3.0](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/changes/#version-3-0-0)
   * Async support no longer requires patching.
   * Lots of weird scoping fixes.
   * I18N supports `pgettext`.
* [Click 8.0](https://click.palletsprojects.com/changes/#version-8-0-0)
   * Completely rewrote the shell tab completion system to be more accurate, customizable, and extensible to new shells.
   * Support for 256 and RGB color output.
   * Options can be given as a flag without a value to use a default value or trigger a prompt.
   * `*` and `~` patterns are expanded on Windows since its terminal doesn't do that automatically.
   * User-facing messages like validation errors can be translated.
* [ItsDangerous 2.0](https://itsdangerous.palletsprojects.com/changes/#version-2-0-0)
* [MarkupSafe 2.0](https://markupsafe.palletsprojects.com/changes/#version-2-0-0)

Four years ago, each project had 150+ open issues, some going back a decade, and pages of open pull requests too. Over time I've grown the maintainer team and the community, and we've managed to cut down the backlog to a much more manageable size. I'm thankful for all contributions and support people have given, and I hope you all continue to build amazing applications with the Pallets projects.",nacc83,Reddit - r/Python
