There have been a few programs in this subreddit which offer a similar functionality but mute spotify, and play another locally-stored song. I preferred not using that method and hence did this.

The code is present below, and is also present in my github repo [here](https://github.com/SakDev/SpotiByeBye).

Once again, I truly would appreciate any constructive feedback!

90,"Howdy, y'all. I'm Al Sweigart (rhymes with ""why dirt""), author of ""Automate the Boring Stuff with Python"" and several other programming books. I release all of my books under a Creative Commons license, so you can read them for free on my website at https://inventwithpython.com

My latest books are [The Big Book of Small Python Projects](https://inventwithpython.com/bigbookpython/) and [Beyond the Basic Stuff with Python](https://inventwithpython.com/beyond/). I'm currently working on a book about recursion (the recursion jokes get funnier every time I hear them) which should be available in 2022. The ideas for this book grew into [a 2018 North Bay Python talk I gave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfBqVVKg4GE).

""Big Book"" contains the source code for 81 games, puzzles, simulations, and animations that were designed to be short and simple to understand. Folks tend to get caught up in repeating yet another ""hello world"" tutorial, but don't quite know how to apply the programming concepts they learned into actual programs. This book is full of source code that they can study to see how real-world programs work. They aren't just code snippets but actual, runnable programs. If you've been told you should ""work on your projects"" but don't know where to start, or if you've been told ""look at the source code of open source projects"" but found them undocumented and inscrutable, check out these programs.

""Beyond the Basic Stuff"" is a sort of follow up to ""Automate the Boring Stuff"" (or any other beginner Python resource). It goes into how professionals write code and best practices they follow. There's information on how to find help on your own, how to format your code and name your variables, an explanation of common programming jargon, the basics of Git, three chapters on object-oriented programming (and more importantly, when and why to use OOP), and more.

You've probably seen [my posts at the start of the month](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/obq0cg/automate_the_boring_stuff_with_python_online/) when I make my online Python course free. About 15,000 to 30,000 people sign up each month, though according to my stats only about 5% of people actually complete the course (which is typical for online courses, free or paid).

I got started writing programming books in 2009 when my then-girlfriend was a nanny for kid who wanted to learn to program. I started writing a book (which would become Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python) and self-published. People liked it, so I kept writing, and Automate was my first book through a traditional publisher, No Starch Press. I quit my software developer job in 2013 to finish writing Automate, thinking I'd get another software dev job in a year. But I kept having more ideas for other books, tutorials, videos, etc. so I'm still here writing.

Oh, and if you can help me out, writing an (honest) Amazon review for my books (especially the latest two) or even just sharing the links to the free online copies would be really help me get them in front of more people.","Hello, world!

And this is what happened in our last meeting - **While we were sharing news about upcoming Jina 2.0 release in the zoom meeting, some loud racist music starts playing automatically and someone starts drawing a d\*ck on the screen.**

It was demotivating to say the least.

Building open-source project is challenging at multiple fronts other than the core technical challenges

* Understand what needs to be built
* Improve that continuously
* Help people understand the project
* Educate people about the domain
* Reach out people who might benefit from your project
* Collaborate with other contributors
* Deal with issues/PRs
* Deal with outdated versions/docs
* **Deal with different opinions**
* Sometimes deal with jerks like the ones who zoombombed us

The list is long! Open-source is hard!

Open-source exists because of some good people out there like you/me who care about the open-source so deeply to invest their time and energy for a little good for everyone else. It exists because of communities like r/python where we can find the support and the motivation. e.g. via this community, I came to know of many use cases of my project, problems and solutions in my project, and even people who supported me build it.

I wanted to vent out my negative experiences and wanted to say a big \*\*Thank you\*\* to you all open-source people, thanks to many(1.6k) contributors who made it possible for us to release \[Jina 2.0\]([https://github.com/jina-ai/jina/](https://github.com/jina-ai/jina/)) 🤗.

117,"In my spare time I like to go through financial data to understand what kind of companies exist, how sectors and industries evolve and to test theoretical frameworks. However, I found that it required a lot of effort to figure out which companies belong to which industry and I often ran into paywalls that blocked me from accessing the exact data I was looking for. Platforms like Bloomberg offer such services but at ridiculous prices (up to $24.000 a year). This can make investment decisions for the retail investor rather difficult especially if you don't want to follow 'the herd'. **I wanted to change that.**

**Insert the** [**FinanceDatabase**](https://github.com/JerBouma/FinanceDatabase)**.** A database of over 180.000 symbols (80k+ companies, 15k+ ETFs, 30k+ Funds, 3k+ Cryptocurrencies and more) that is fully categorised per country, industry, sector, category and more. It features a 'Searcher' package (***pip install FinanceDatabase***) that has a user-friendly way of collecting the exact data you want (downloaded straight from the repository). For example, the following code returns all (listed) airlines in the United States (check [Examples](https://github.com/JerBouma/FinanceDatabase#Examples) for more info) :

    import FinanceDatabase as fd
    
    airlines_us = fd.select_equities(country='United States', industry='Airlines')

And the following gives insights in ETFs that have anything to do with 'semiconductor':

    import FinanceDatabase as fd
    
    all_etfs = fd.select_etfs()
    semiconductor_etfs = fd.search_products(all_etfs, 'semiconductor')

What I explicitly am *not* trying to do is re-invent the wheel (again) of Fundamental Data gathering as there are tons of packages out there that do that already (i.e. [FundamentalAnalysis](https://github.com/JerBouma/FundamentalAnalysis), [yfinance](https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance), [sec-edgar](https://github.com/sec-edgar/sec-edgar)) but instead allow you to capture sector, industries, specific types of ETFs or cryptocurrencies that would have otherwise resulted in a lot of manual work. Then, when you have this sub-selection you can make use of the earlier mentioned packages.

**If you want to know what is available inside the Database, please have a look** [here](https://github.com/JerBouma/FinanceDatabase/tree/master/Database)**.** Alternatively, you can do the following (an example):

    import FinanceDatabase as fd
    
    equities_countries = fd.show_options('equities','countries') # or sector/industry
    etfs_categories = fd.show_options('etfs')
    cryptocurrencies = fd.show_options('cryptocurrencies')

I hope this can help some of you out making (better) investment decisions and all feedback (positive and negative) and contribution is much appreciated.

I am new to reddit, and after reading some posts of people expressing their frustration learning Python, I thought I would write about my own story on how learning Python helped save my life, and perhaps more importantly, gave my life meaning. I will try to be as brief as I can in my back story to keep this as relevant to Python as possible, but I feel it would be a disservice to leave it out completely, as my issues with mental health were a primary driver of the motivation I took advantage of to learn Python. I will post a more detailed description of my backstory later in r/addiciton or r/depression_help or something similar. Feel free to skip to the second \*\*\* to go straight to when I started learning python, however I suggest you read the whole post because honestly my whole story is relevant. If I hadn't gone through what I went through, I doubt I would have had the motivation to self-teach myself Python.

I grew up in a wealthy, extremely homogenous town within an hour of New York City. I went to a public school, but if you saw the way people dressed, it looked more like a private prep school. The vast majority of the kids in my school had parents who were millionaires. My parents were not. I was an only child, and I grew up in a small apartment on the ""poor"" side of town (""poor"" meaning houses/ apartments went for &lt; 750k). As you can imagine, the social structure of the school was entirely based off the wealth of your parents. So the game was rigged against me from the beginning. I had very few friends at a young age, and most people in my middle school probably would have described me as a ""loser"" or another synonymous term. I was very unhappy and became addicted to video games as a mean to escape my life. During high school, I finally started branching out to meet people from the surrounding towns, who were not nearly as pretentious as the people I grew up with. I made a lot of friends and started to have a legitimate social life. However, with this new social life came a lot of superficiality and drinking/drug using. 

Until my senior year of high school, my grades were mediocre at best. Because I hated my social life at school, I hated school in general. But in my senior year, something changed. I won't detail it in this post, but will certainly get into it more in my next post in r/addiction or r/depression_help . I improved my grades and went to community college for my first year. I ended that year with a 3.9 GPA and an acceptance to one of the best colleges in my state. I transferred to that college and thought my life from there on out would be perfect. I was wrong.

I hated the social scene of my college. I found it to be very superficial and revolved almost entirely around drinking. Later I realized that while this was true for the people I was surrounding myself with, nobody forced me to surround myself with those people. I did it because I thought that this was the only way to enjoy college, and if I didn't, I would be missing out on the experience of my life. Man, what a load of BS I let myself believe. This expectation set me up for failure, and I blamed myself entirely. I thought I was worthless, a loser, and that all the mean things people said about me in my hometown back in middle school were true. I fell into a deep depression and eventually dropped out. 

Towards the end of my time away at this state school, I saw a psychiatrist who prescribed me Adderall and Xanax to treat my depression and learning disabilities. In the beginning, they worked wonders, but they certainly didn't solve the underlying issues, they actually made them worse. After I dropped out, I began to rely on them completely. Before long, I was blacking out all the time as a result of the Xanax, and up for days at a time as a result of the Adderall. It was always one or the other, and I had to use the other to counter the negative effects of one. 

For the next few years, I battled with addiction and depression to the point where I felt hopeless. I would get a week or two or three sober, then relapse. Somehow I managed to go back to a local college during this time, but my grades were mediocre, because I would miss a week of school every time I would relapse. Eventually I went away to rehab for four months. This is where I started to learn Python. I was very fortunate to have parents who loved me enough to spend the money to send me to a place for four months. I know not everyone has this privilege, and it is my goal to pay my parents back the money they spent on me.

&amp;#x200B;

The rehab I went to was basically in the middle of nowhere, and while I was inpatient the first month, the last three months I was in what was essentially a nicer version of a sober house. I worked part- time at a restaurant (\~20 hours a week). I had computer access, and I found myself very bored during the first week or two, so I decided to learn something I had always wanted to learn: Programming. I bought a few courses off [udemy.com](https://udemy.com) for \~$12/each (NEVER pay full price of a Udemy course. You can always get them discounted), and started learning. Pretty much anytime I wasn't working or going to AA meetings, I was programming. I essentially replaced my addiction to drugs with an addiction to learning. I really enjoyed it, but in hindsight, I overdid it, as any addict does. I came home after four months, and I fell back into old patterns, and relapsed just before I would have been 6 months sober. I will go into more detail about this in my posts in r/addiction / r/depression_help .

During my time in rehab, I completed 3 Udemy courses on Python, but honestly I only really learned the fundamentals. I've never been a very quick learner, as I have a processing disorder (I was always the last one to finish tests in school and it always took me longer to do assignments etc). I frequently got frustrated, and rarely took breaks. I would spend 4-8 hours a day practicing coding, but much of that time was obsessing over one thing that I couldn't figure out. This was a big part of why I burnt myself out. Later, I found that if I ran into a problem I couldn't figure out, and forced myself to take a break, 95% of the time I would figure it out within 10 minutes of coming back from a 15-20 minute break. The mind is funny like that. 

Fast forward about 6 months and I was back in rehab, this time for only 30 days. I came home and luckily got an internship at a very small investment firm, where they used python to trade stocks algorithmically. There, I had a boss who was a very good programmer, and he gave me real projects to do that required me to think critically. He rarely gave me any help. Most of the time when I asked a question he would say ""I know the answer, but you have to figure it out. It's the only way you'll learn"". This frustrated me at the time, but looking back it was probably one of the best things anyone ever did for me. I developed resourcefulness and patience, two incredibly imperative skills for any programmer who wants to be worth his/her salt. During this time, I was taking a few classes at a local college to finally finish my degree, and I was working anywhere from 15-40 hours a week at this investment firm, unpaid. I honestly worked a bit too hard, I almost burnt myself out again, but I managed to get through it. I was very lucky in that my parents helped me financially during this time, which allowed me to focus more on school and work. I had a few relapses during this period, but they were short and mild, so it didn't throw me off track too badly. 

Over this past summer I finished up my degree (I majored in Business) and started looking for jobs. I was sure to put as much of my accomplishments at the small investment firm that involved python on my resume as I could. Covid was (and is) still wreaking havoc on the economy, so I worked extra hard applying to jobs, making connections, and keeping my skills sharp. I honestly probably applied to over 2500 jobs. I only got maybe 3-4 interviews. I had one during the end of the summer that went to the final round, and I was sure I was going to get the job. I didn't. Instead, the company (according to a connection I had made within the company cold-emailing people) decided to hire people from India to save money. I definitely felt pretty hopeless at that point. But I didn't give up. Maybe a month later, I got an interview for a job at a major company as a Data Analyst. I had three rounds of interviews plus I had to send them examples of some of my Python projects. I didn't get my hopes up like I did last time, out of fear of being disappointed. To my surprise, I got the job. I had asked for a 50k salary. They gave me 60k base plus a 5k bonus contingent on my performance, plus great benefits. 

I've been at this job for a little over a month, and I honestly love it. I find myself excited to go to work every day, and the people really like me because I am able to provide real value to the company. In my first month, I worked a lot on automation of otherwise very manual tasks (usually involving excel or emails). I would ask people how many hours per week they would generally spend on such a task and wrote it down. I recently did the math and realized that I have so far saved the company over 750 hours of work per year, and that’s a conservative estimate using a 48 week year (to account for holidays, vacation etc.) and the low end of their estimated range of hours per week. This frees the employees up to work on more value added (and frankly much more interesting) projects. My work there is just beginning, and there are a ton of projects I am really excited about.

I can honestly say I am happy now. I have over 4 months sober, and I rarely have any cravings to use drugs anymore. I really think this is largely because I found purpose in my life. That said, I still attend AA meetings often because I know I have to keep my sobriety my first priority. Without it, I have nothing. I also know that life isn't going to be perfect every day. While I do consider myself happy today, I still have bad days. Such is life. I stopped expecting to feel good all the time. Life is not designed that way. Before, I was only ""happy"" if I had a substance in my system. Also, ""happy"" to me was a euphoric rush which felt good, but was never fulfilling. Now I define happiness differently. It doesn't mean I feel good all the time. It means that despite sometimes not feeling good, I can appreciate how lucky I am to be alive and how blessed I am to have been given a second chance. Getting out of the rut that I found myself in a few years ago was the hardest thing I have ever done, but it was 100% worth it. At the risk of sounding corny, I really do believe sometimes you have to fall down hard and struggle getting back up to appreciate your life.

Learning Python was part of my journey, and it wasn't easy at all. When I started, I had a lot of doubts that I could do it. I didn't think ""people like me"" would be successful at something like this. Again, I was wrong. While I am certainly not even close to an expert at Programming/Python, I am good enough to be hired at a large company and good enough to make a difference. I'm sure there are people on Reddit and elsewhere that could make me look like I started programming last week. But I try not to compare myself to others. I instead try to compare myself to who I was before, and who I want to be in the future. As I’ve said several times before, I will make another post with more details about my experience with addiction/depression and give my general tips for life there, but for now here are my general tips for learning Python:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

1. I suggest starting with the fundamentals. I used Jose Portilla's Udemy course for this and it was great. I will link it at the bottom along with some other resources.

2. If you struggle motivating yourself to follow online courses, try figuring out a real project to do that can actually help you in everyday life. This could be automating something you do in your job, for school, or just something you think will be fun. 

3. Work Hard. Don't give up. But don't burn yourself out. Take frequent breaks, especially when you get frustrated. 

4. Ask for help. If you’re struggling with a specific problem, r/learnpython is great, along with [Stackoverflow.com](https://Stackoverflow.com) . People have helped me with many problems there.

5. Trust the Process. Programming is a lot like learning an instrument in my opinion. At first it can be grueling and you won’t be able to do much for a while, but after you learn the fundamentals, it becomes incredibly enjoyable. 

6. Be consistent. This is extremely important. Try to set aside a time every day to practice. Even if it’s only 20-30 minutes. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

There are many more tips that I have but those are the most important ones I can think of. Please feel free to follow me as I hope to be quite active on reddit in the future. If you have any questions, please message me. Whether it's about Python, Addiction, Depression, or whatever else. I'll do my best to answer everyone I can.

What to learn next is an often asked question. [Searching for `what next` on /r/learnpython](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/search?q=what+next&amp;restrict_sr=on) gives you too many results. Here's some more Q&amp;A and articles on this topic:

* [I know how to program, but I don't know what to program](https://www.devdungeon.com/content/i-know-how-program-i-dont-know-what-program)

* [Things you might encounter in your programming journey](https://www.techinasia.com/talk/27-things-started-programming)

## Exercises and Projects

I do not have a simple answer to this question either. If you feel comfortable with programming basics and Python syntax, then exercises are a good way to test your knowledge. The resource you used to learn Python will typically have some sort of exercises, so those would be ideal as a first choice. I'd also suggest using the below resources to improve your skills. If you get stuck, reread the material related to those topics, search online, ask for clarifications, etc  — in short, make an effort to solve it. It is okay to skip some troublesome problems (and come back to it later if you have the time), but you should be able to solve most of the beginner problems. Maintaining notes will help too, especially for common mistakes.

* [Exercism](https://exercism.io/tracks/python/exercises), [Practicepython](https://www.practicepython.org/), [Edabit](https://edabit.com/challenges/python3) — these are all beginner friendly and difficulty levels are marked
* [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/), [Adventofcode](https://adventofcode.com/), [Projecteuler](https://projecteuler.net/) — more challenging
* [Checkio](https://py.checkio.org/), [Codingame](https://www.codingame.com/start), [Codecombat](https://codecombat.com/play/level/dungeons-of-kithgard) — gaming based challenges
* [/r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer) — not active currently, but there's plenty of past challenges with discussions

Once you are comfortable with basics and syntax, the next step is projects. I use a 10-line program that solves a common problem for me — adding `body { text-align: justify }` to `epub` files that are not justify aligned. I didn't know that this line would help beforehand, I searched online for a solution and then automated the process of unzipping `epub`, adding the line and then packing it again. That will likely need you to lookup documentation and go through some stackoverflow Q&amp;A as well. And once you have written the solution and use it regularly, you'll likely encounter corner cases and features to be added. I feel this is a great way to learn and understand programming.

## Debugging

Knowing how to debug your programs is crucial and should be ideally taught right from the beginning instead of a chapter at the end of the book. [Think Python](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/) is an awesome example for such a resource material.

Sites like [Pythontutor](http://www.pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit) allow you to visually debug a program — you can execute a program step by step and see the current value of variables. Similar feature is typically provided by IDEs like [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) and [Thonny](https://thonny.org/). Under the hood, these visualizations are using the [pdb module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html). See also [Python debugging with pdb](https://realpython.com/python-debugging-pdb/).

Debugging is often a frustrating experience. Taking a break helps (and sometimes I have found the problem in my dreams). Try to reduce the code as much as possible so that you are left with minimal code necessary to reproduce the issue. Talking about the problem to a friend/colleague/inanimate-objects/etc can help too — known as [Rubber duck debugging](https://rubberduckdebugging.com/). I have often found the issue while formulating a question to be asked on forums like stackoverflow/reddit because writing down your problem is another way to bring clarity than just having a vague idea in your mind. Here's some more articles on this challenging topic:

* [What does debugging a program look like?](https://jvns.ca/blog/2019/06/23/a-few-debugging-resources/)
* [How to debug small programs](https://ericlippert.com/2014/03/05/how-to-debug-small-programs/)
* [Debugging guide](https://uchicago-cs.github.io/debugging-guide/)
* [Problem solving skills](https://ryanstutorials.net/problem-solving-skills/)

Here's an interesting snippet (modified to keep it small) from a collection of [interesting bug stories](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/169713/whats-the-toughest-bug-you-ever-found-and-fixed).

&gt;A jpeg parser choked whenever the CEO came into the room, because he always had a shirt with a square pattern on it, which triggered some special case of contrast and block boundary algorithms.

See also [curated list of absurd software bug stories](https://500mile.email/).

## Testing

Another crucial aspect in the programming journey is knowing how to write tests. In bigger projects, usually there are separate engineers (often in much larger number than code developers) to test the code. Even in those cases, writing a few sanity test cases yourself can help you develop faster knowing that the changes aren't breaking basic functionality.

There's no single consensus on test methodologies. There is [Unit testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing), [Integration testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_testing), [Test-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) and so on. Often, a combination of these is used. These days, machine learning is also being considered to reduce the testing time, see [Testing Firefox more efficiently with machine learning](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2020/07/testing-firefox-more-efficiently-with-machine-learning/) for example.

When I start a project, I usually try to write the programs incrementally. Say I need to iterate over files from a directory. I will make sure that portion is working (usually with `print` statements), then add another feature — say file reading and test that and so on. This reduces the burden of testing a large program at once at the end. And depending upon the nature of the program, I'll add a few sanity tests at the end. For example, for my [command_help](https://github.com/learnbyexample/command_help) project, I copy pasted a few test runs of the program with different options and arguments into a separate file and wrote a program to perform these tests programmatically whenever the source code is modified.

For non-trivial projects, you'll usually end up needing frameworks like built-in module `unittest` or third-party modules like `pytest`. See [Getting started with testing in Python](https://realpython.com/python-testing/) and [calmcode: pytest](https://calmcode.io/pytest/introduction.html) for discussion on these topics.

I was inspired to make this after finding that applications like Excel, Tableau and JMP were often quicker than Python for ad hoc viewing, plotting and reshaping. This project aims to make basic EDA easy but also allows you to easily move DataFrames in memory between the GUI and IPython so you still have the full power of Pandas. It's made with PyQt5 and renders in a standalone window compatible with any IDE.

190,"Spent 5 hours coding for what could have been hundreds of hours of work. I can't believe I actually did it. Lol

Of course I did it with the help of my google-fu but the fact that I was able to do it is such a great feeling of accomplishment. Received a ""Great Work!"" message from my boss too.


EDIT: HERE'S WHAT I DID. I kinda messed up not including this in the main post.

Basically I needed to make comparison of a new cloned server vs our old one.

It has hundreds if not thousand of tables that I'll need to do binary check sums of to ensure that the newly created servers and dbs are completely identical and that the etl procedures are loading the data correctly with the correct data types and values etc.

So without automation I'll have to do this hundreds if not thousands of times manually:

Run checksum code on old server then run on old server, save the checksum results on an excel worksheet as documentation if they or did not match.

What I did is I created a python automation program that gets a list of all tables in a db within a server, then iterates over all those tables and executes the binary check sum query again and again using the tables on a list then saves all the query result on a csv file. 

I appended the csv output names with the server name to make them distinct after every run. Then I load that csv to an excel file and then do the final IF comparisons there. 

So instead of doing that manual comparison for hundreds of hours, I was able to do it in 5 hours of coding and now runs for 30 second per database then voila, instant results.

I managed to make a script that asks for project number, checks of the folder is there, copies and modifies the cells of the excel sheet to the correct project number etc. I had to google almost everything, how do i folder scan? how do i manipulate excel? etc etc.

## What is PyBoy

In short, it’s a Game Boy emulator written from scratch in pure Python, with additional support for scripting through an API. We’ve added type definitions, which allows us to compile the software using Cython to get performance comparable to emulators written in C and C++.

## Installation

The installation instructions are simple: Install SDL2 on your system, and install PyBoy through `pip install pyboy`. If you need to compile from source, we also have detailed instructions on the GitHub Wiki for Mac, Linux and Windows.

[https://github.com/Baekalfen/PyBoy/wiki/Installation](https://github.com/Baekalfen/PyBoy/wiki/Installation)

## Features

PyBoy is designed to be accessible from Python, so we support and encourage people who want to make experiments, bots or AI’s to try it out. We are building game-specific wrappers, which at the moment allows programmers to interface with Tetris and Super Mario Land, without any intricate knowledge of the Game Boy. Documentation can be found at: [https://docs.pyboy.dk](https://docs.pyboy.dk/) .

We also want to learn and experiment with more exotic features. Based on work from a university project, we’ve added rewinding to the emulator. Which means, you’ll be able to turn back time in any game.

Recently I had to integrate Python as a scripting language into a large c++ project and though I should get to know the language first. And let me tell you, it's simply magical.

""I can add properties to classes dynamically? And delete them?"" ""Functions don't even care about the number of arguments?"" ""Need to do something? There's a library for that.""

It's absolutely crazy. And I love it. I have to be honest, the most amazing about this is how easy it is to embed.

I could give Python the project's memory allocator and the interpreter immediately uses the main memory pool of the project. I could redirect the interpreter's stdout / stderr channels to the project as well. Extending the language and exposing c++ functions are a breeze.

Python essentially supercharges c++.

Now, I'm not going to change my preference of c/c++ any time soon, but I just had to make a post about how nicely Python works as a scripting language in a c++ project. Cheers",My experience learning Python as a c++ developer,0.0,gc691l,Reddit - r/Python,226.0

243,"Maybe I am the only idiot who has done something like this but I just wanted to share my embarrassing interview experience. Let's cut it to the chase, so I had this video interview where I was given a question and a shared editor.  I decided to use a dictionary for my solution (one of my favorite ds) and named the variable as myDict. While I was explaining my logic, I made sure I was emphasizing the letter 't' whenever I pronounced myDict (so that it doesn't sound like my\_dick). Anyway, while I was typing the solution and explaining, obviously, my brain started concentrating on the code and I wasn't paying much attention to what I was saying. Apparently, my pronunciation started sounding like 'my dick'. On top of that, I was using that dick so much to the point that interviewer started laughing. Imagine when you are explaining the space complexity and you say something along the lines 'the size of myDict is proportional to the size of input array'. Anyone else has done something embarrassing like this?

249,"I do freelance python development in mainly web scraping, automation, building very simple Flask APIs, simple Vue frontend and more or less doing what I like to call ""general-purpose programming"".

Now, I am reasonably skilled in python, I believe. Don't write OOP and class-based python unless I am doing more than 100 lines of code. Most often write pretty simple stuff but most of the time goes into problem-solving.

But I despise freelancing. 1 out of every 3 comments/posts I make on Reddit is how much I hate doing freelancing. I come to Reddit to vent so I am sorry to the fellas who is reading this because they are more or less my punching bag :( I am sorry sir/madam. I am just having a bad life, it will end soon.

So, today I am going to rant about one of the more """"fun"""" things of freelancing, client telling me they know python.

Whenever a client tells me that they know python, I try to ignore them but often times I have to entertain the idea anyway because jobs are scarce. I keep telling myself ""maybe this will work out great"" but it doesn't.

It never goes right. Here is the thing. If you do what I do you will realize the code is often quite simple. Most of the effort goes into problem-solving. So when the client sees the code and me getting paid by the hour, ""They are like I thought you are *best darn python developer* I could have written that myself!""

My immediate impulse is to go on a rant and call that person something rotten. But I have to maintain ""professionalism"".

Then there is the issue of budgeting. I do fixed payment contracts for smaller engagements. But oftentimes these python experts will quote me something that is at least one-fourth of a reasonable budget. And by reasonable I mean non-US reasonable budget which is already one-fifth of a reasonable US programming project budget. But anyway they quote that because they know how is easy it is to do my job.

There is more because this is rant by the way. So, clients with python knowledge will say to me ""I have this python file..."" which is the worst thing to say at this point. They think they have done the ""majority"" of the work. But here is the way I see it-

a. Either they have just barely scratched the surface
b. They have a jumbled up mess
c. They had another dev look into the project who already failed
d. They had to do a ""code review"" of their previous freelancer and they ended up stealing the code

There is no positive way to imagine this problem. I have seen too much crappy code and too much of arguments like ""they had done the work for me, so I should charge near to nothing"".

People don't know exactly why senior devs get paid so much money. Junior devs write code, senior devs review code. That is why they get paid more. Making sense of other people's code is a risky and frustrating thing and it could be incredibly time-consuming. And moreover in most cases building upon a codebase is more difficult than writing it from the scratch.

Doctors rant about ""expert"" patients earning their MDs from WebMD and I am seeing the exact same thing happen to me with clients knowing how to write loops in python.

Python is easy to learn, programming these days is easy to learn. But people are not paying programmers for writing loops and if statements. They are paying them to solve problems.

254,"Hey folks! My friend and I are building [Devbook](https://usedevbook.com). It’s a desktop app that allows you to search in Stack Overflow, search and read documentation, and search public code on GitHub from a single place. The whole app can be controlled just using a keyboard. No need to use your mouse. This way, it’s easier to stay in the flow.

The app works similarly to Spotlight on macOS. You hit a global shortcut and Devbook appears as an overlay over the currently active app. This way you minimalize the needed context switching when looking up information. You almost don't leave your coding editor.

You can think about Devbook as a search engine made just for developers. But no ads, content marketing, SEO, etc.

I thought the community here might find it useful. Currently, we support Python, Flask, Django docs, and adding more with time.

Give it a try and let me know what you think!

**EDIT**

Some folks have been asking us for the pricing. Devbook is free. The plan is to build team features later on and have subscriptions for teams and organizations. If it will be possible, we want to always have a free plan for solo developers.

However, if you really want to support us, I just set up the [Buy Me A Coffee page](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/P8dyVmoAF) for Devbook. You can donate a small amount if you feel comfortable. It will probably make us jump around from the excitement since it would be our first revenue:)

**EDIT 2**

Oh, boy did this blow-up! Every week, we just share Devbook in various subreddits we think might enjoy it. We didn't expect to blow it up that much at all. Thank you all folks for trying Devbook out. It means a lot.

&amp;#x200B;

For the near future Devbook release, we're building an extensions system that will allow you to add search functionality we don't support out of the box. Imagine Google customizable through vscode-like extensions. You can read more [here](https://github.com/DevbookHQ/devbook-extension).

There's a great package called ConfigParser which you can use which simplifies creating config files (like the windows .ini files) so that it takes as much effort as hardcoding!

[LazyWeb: Anonymous and ad-free search made in Python](https://reddit.com/link/odhbql/video/hii57yv446971/player)

[https://lazyweb.ai](https://lazyweb.ai)

We're a little two-person team (Angie and Jem). We're bootstrapping and self-funded. I'm the programmer.

I wanted to share it because it was a fun and interesting project to build, and Python made it possible for us to get a long way as a small team. It uses serverless on the backend (AWS). We're using Spacy and GPT-2, and some PyTorch models. It uses BeautifulSoup for spidering/crawling/content retrieval. The front-end is React.

It has a different type of user interface to any other search engine, as it is chat based. And it lets you choose how you view results, either visually like an Instagram feed or cards, or minimal like Hacker News or the old Google. It tries to fight SEO spam and strips out ads and ad-tech from search results.

We have a project on GitHub with Jupyter notebooks and sample data with experiments and scripts, including examples of querying other search APIs, and to generate example utterances programatically to use for NLP models with sources like Wikipedia, StackOverflow and Wolfram|Alpha:

We're only a small team but hope to share more of our work as open source as we progress.","New search engine made with Python that's anonymous and has no ads or tracking. It tries to fight spam, and gives you control of how you view search results. You can search and read content anonymously with a proxied reader view. The alpha is live and free for anyone to use at lazyweb.ai",0.0,odhbql,Reddit - r/Python,214.0

TLDW: When I want to **automate actions on a site**, such as logins or forms, or scraping pages with JavaScript, **I manually** inspect each web element I need and begin writing a script.

***I'm lazy though*** and had the idea to automate the creation of these automation/testing scripts. And thus ""Sillynium"" was born.

Sillynium allows you to **draw boxes around the elements you require** on a page and automatically gets the element and its properties for you. Different coloured rectangles tell the program you want to do different things. Eg: Red means ""Input text"", Green means ""Click button"".

**When you've finished drawing boxes, a working python selenium script is generated**. If you run that script, it does exactly what you told it to do! All this without you writing any code, and losing time.

I made this project over the course of a day as a quick and dirty proof of concept. Its very flawed in its current iteration (taking a screenshot of webpage), so V2 I'm trying to figure out how to draw directly to the browser. Critique it and rip it to shreds. I'm aware of browser recorders btw so I know those exist, this is my twist on automation

**Edit**: I was not prepared for the amount of interest in this little proof of concept! So thank you all very much for your time you’ve made my day :)

In the interest of transparency and to answer your questions about the code and my plans:

I originally thought about monetisation (web extension etc) after finishing this POC (\*\*sigh i know I’m a greedy bastard) but now I’m in 2 minds about it!

On the one hand I want to make it free for personal use, on the other hand I’d like to potentially charge for commercial use (once its finished).

*Final edit 2* The community has spoken, I WILL BE RELEASING THIS VERSION AS OPEN SOURCE! I did some light refactoring, and have added it to a repo which will be shared in a follow up. It shows the POC and the community is welcome to build on the original idea :) 

I will create a follow up post with links to repo once I’ve created it, this will be my first project on GitHub so try be nice ;) pretty nervous about sharing my code :D
